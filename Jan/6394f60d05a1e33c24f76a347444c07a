POLOKWANE – The Mayor John Mpe urged community members, learners and teachers at various schools in the city to work together in order to achieve good results. Mpe addressed various schools at the reopening of the school year on January 11. Some of the schools that Mpe visited are Capricorn High School, Flora Park High School, Taxila Secondary School and Nirvana Primary School. “Let us work together this year and years to come to become a joyous and caring community with the common goals of nurturing responsible, caring learners and promoting high-level learning. It is time for some new stories of great learning. It begins now. Go, be awesome. The opportunity to refuel is a key component to doing great work. Now is your chance to start fresh, a chance to renew, a chance to build on the progress that was made in the last school year and dream about what is possible in the future.” He added that education is a societal issue critical in facilitating the capacity of the municipalities to deliver services and good governance. “We invest in libraries and bursary funds and continue to invest largely in education, because it is only through education that one can break away from the shackles of poverty and launch into the world. We welcome and value your positive energy and dedication to excellence in education, and we look forward to working with you as teachers and learners.” He said that whatever result learners achieved last year, they must go back to the classroom to prepare for a productive year. “Our skilled and devoted teachers are, for sure, already planning and preparing for you, learners. We must use our renewed strength to focus on what matters most, getting the learners back in the classroom and making our education system better than it ever was before, making sure every learner gets he excellent education they deserve,” Mpe said.
