POLOKWANE – The end of the year usually offers a brief break from work but after the holidays are over, getting back into work mode can be a bit challenging. The first thing you feel is sudden tiredness which is often referred to as ‘post-holiday blues’. This is as a result from days of celebration, sleeping in, spending time with family and relaxing over the festive period. Local life coach Marie-Lee du Plooy says the sudden tiredness is because our brains had a break from day-to-day tasks and planning and suddenly, we have to start over again. “Just thinking about everything that we must face this year, makes us tired. If your mind and attitude are set correctly, then you will know how to face new challenges and how to handle problems,” she told the Review-Observer. Du Plooy said even though it isn’t easy and that one is not in the mood to snap out of the holiday cheer, setting small goals will help you start the new year feeling positive. She advised the following to do daily to beat the post-holiday blues: • Get back to routine as soon as possible. This can include getting up at the same time in the morning, taking the kids to school and going to work, or going for a jog.
• Eat a proper breakfast with healthier snacks during the day.
• Take breaks in between your hectic schedules.
• Look forward to achieving your new year’s resolutions.
