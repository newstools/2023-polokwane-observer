POLOKWANE – Basha Tlhapane’s focus is providing children with free medical and surgical care. Tlhapane is the founder of the Sister Basha CSI initiative which forms part of a children’s ministry group that works with children suffering from diseases such as cancer to access free health and social welfare support. She founded the initiative in 2007 and encourages people to volunteer by identifying challenges faced in poor communities. “Each child’s story brings tears to my eyes. It is quite hard to comprehend the fact that there are so many communities that don’t have clean water, sanitation, electricity and a nearby clinic. As a result, some children die of minor untreated ailments or go undiagnosed due to no access to healthcare facilities. Tlhapane said the Sister Basha initiative aims to support children with special needs, rare, chronic and weakening diseases and with welfare intervention. In other areas, the initiative has already helped children with pro-bono surgeries, supported eight children organisations as well as pediatric medical, welfare and foster care cases and a legacy programme for girls. The organisation can be found on social media on Facebook, Twitter and via Whatsapp on 067 959 4308 for donations or volunteers.
