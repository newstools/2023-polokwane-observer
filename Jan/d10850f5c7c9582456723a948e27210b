Summer holidays can be messy and hectic, but you don’t want to spend all your time cleaning and tidying. With these tips, you should be able to get most of the work done in about thirty minutes each day, freeing up precious time for rest and recuperation. Two of the most important holiday cleaning tips are to stay on top of the chores and not allow clutter to build up. Daily tasks could include: Bathrooms are used a lot, and although everyone should clean the bathroom after using them, other parts need daily attention. Most kitchens get a lot of traffic, so they need more attention than other rooms. During the holidays, living room furniture gets a lot more use. Use a hand vacuum to get rid of crumbs under and between couch cushions. You should also spot-clean, taking care of dirty marks immediately with a cleaner for your type of furniture. Last thing before bed: One way to really save some time is to give yourself the gift of a robot vacuum and let it run every morning while you are busy with other chores – or lounging at the pool. It will run for one to two hours before returning to its charger. Robot vacuums range in price from R400 to around R4 000, so you are sure to find one that meets your needs – and your budget. Some models also have a mop function. You will never have to vacuum or sweep again – even after the holidays are over. Getting the whole family involved in doing household chores can be an excellent way for parents and children to bond. Delegate tasks according to age and ability, and with all hands on deck, your home will be spick and span in next to no time. And if you are too busy having fun to tackle the essential cleaning tasks, give yourselves a holiday gift and call in professional cleaners to do it for you. Writer : Sarah-Jane Meyer
