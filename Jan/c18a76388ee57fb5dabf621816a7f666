The humble, helpful and hard-working learner as described by his peers and teachers, obtained seven distinctions with a score of 300/300 in mathematics, physical science and accounting. “I still haven’t gotten to terms with the fact that I am number one in the province.” Phenyo shared that throughout the year, he faced challenges which deprived him of social time, but he knew he had a goal to reach. I had a goal in mind, but I didn’t anticipate that I would end up representing the province. I feel as though I have exceeded my goal and from now I will work hard to represent the country, not just my province.” His advice to current learners in Gr 12 is to make sacrifices for what they want and to put enough effort into their studies. “A wise man once told me that you must make sacrifices for the things you want because if you don’t, the things you want will then become the sacrifice.” Phenyo said he looks forward to furthering his studies in medicine at the University of Cape Town. Taxila Secondary School is the top-performing school in the Pietersburg Circuit with a stunning 99.3% pass rate in the National Senior Certificate compared to the previous year when they obtained a 99.2% pass rate.
