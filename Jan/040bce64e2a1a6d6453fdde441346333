POLOKWANE – The Limpopo MEC for Health Dr Phophi Ramathuba has defended allegations made against her on social media following a visit to the Rethabile Clinic last week, where she was filmed reprimanding a manager and staff, stating that she was simply doing her job. Ramathuba said she had received complaints about patients being sent away because they were not wearing masks, as well as issues of queues and she consequently conducted an unannounced visit. In the video, taken from a half-hour live video posted on the Department’s facebook page, Ramathuba asks a manager at the clinic why she could not compromise her lunch hour to attend to patients after the manager told her the clinic was full of patients waiting to be assisted.

What is difficult about that? I know you have a right to go and have lunch, but the reality is that a problem won’t disappear if you do not solve it,” she is seen telling the manager. The video has since gone viral with commentary both for and against Ramathuba’s unannounced visit and calling out of staff. In a telephonic interview with the Review-Observer, Ramathuba said patients are no longer going to the media with their complaints, but to her. “That shows confidence in the department and that means we must do our work. Those who know me know that I do not lead or manage from my office. I am in contact with the realities I find on the ground,” she said. Ramathuba backed up her actions by saying that workers who aren’t doing their jobs will feel humiliated by her visit because it has exposed their failure to do what they were employed to do. “I cannot manage for someone who was employed to do that. Some people do not understand boardroom talk and the diplomatic approach. We have used diplomacy all along and it has not worked. You’ve got to shake up those who don’t work. Queues at Rethabile are now moving quicker because they don’t know when we’ll be back,” she said. Ramathuba said it is unfortunate that the public take video snippets and post these on social media without understanding the full context of the situation. “This was no public relations exercise. I was just doing my job to protect the innocent lives of women, pregnant women and their unborn children,” she said. She added that political parties will see her actions as grandstanding as it shows that people have confidence in government to do what they were mandated to do. Her remarks follow a statement by the EFF in Limpopo that labelled her a bully and stated that she had humiliated and embarrassed staff. 🔺Media Statement🔺 -EFF Condemns Humiliation Of Nursing Staff By Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba. pic.twitter.com/GTPfcOAXKN — Economic Freedom Fighters Limpopo (@EFF_Limpopo) January 24, 2023  “I did not bully anybody or embarrass anyone. A manager cannot be the first one on lunch when a clinic is full, is that embarrassment or is it factual? I raised my voice because the staff were lying to me. How is it bullying if I am asking someone to do their job,” she said. Ramathuba is no stranger to viral videos and the support and backlash she receives from it and when asked whether this hampers her efforts as the MEC for Health, she said she expects the best, the worst and the extreme. “I have to ask who I’m defending and that answers my reason to get up in the morning and go to work. I lead my department with tough love,” she said. Some of the reactions on Twitter: I just wish Dr Phophi Ramathuba can just sit in her air-conditioned office just for 6 months fela. Otla bone ya'll will be complaining about no service delivery. Because when she does her job ya'll still complaining.
