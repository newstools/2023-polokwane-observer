POLOKWANE – Thomas Mangoale is one of the many local businesspersons who hopes to survive load-shedding. Mangoale is the owner of Thabelang Jewellers, a jewellery designing, manufacturing and repairs business he founded 13 years ago. His business, which is located at the Indian Centre in Polokwane, has suffered a hit, but fortunately for Mangoale, he has loyal clients who ensure that he constantly has work to keep him busy. Award-winning Mangoale has clients from as far as Durban, who rely on him as their goldsmith. He says his interest in the industry started in 2005 when he took part in Imfundiso Skills Development; a skill transfer initiative aimed at historically disadvantaged and unemployed youths. Although he is still staying afloat, business has taken a dive, he says. “Load-shedding affects everything. Sometimes I’m fortunate to have clients who understand why I can’t meet targets on time, however, sometimes, I am expected to perform miracles,” he said. He added that he has accepted that life must go on despite the challenge with load-shedding, he needs to find ways to work around it. Mangoale added that his main means of surviving is now through the repairs side of business. With repairs, he can complete the job quickly and get paid, whereas with the design and manufacturing side of the business, it can take up to a month to get a complete product and then get paid. In his free time, Mangoale is a karateka who has been doing karate since 1996. This, he says, has contributed to his discipline, patience and respect where sport and business are concerned. “When I am not at the gym, you will find me at work or at church,” he says about how he spends his free time.
