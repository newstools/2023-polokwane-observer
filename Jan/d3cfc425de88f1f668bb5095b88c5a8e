Fifty seven jurors representing 22 countries gave the Avenger a score of 328 points which placed it a whopping 87 points ahead of the second placed competitor. The new Avenger is a compact SUV that, at just 4m in length, is well-positioned within in the rapidly growing B-SUV segment. It offers 115kW and 260Nm of power a range of up to 400km on the open road and 550km in the city. Søren W Rasmussen, the new president of the Car of the Year jury, said, “The Jeep Avenger is a well-deserved winner of Car of the Year. In a convincing way, it reflects the time the car world has entered, and it radiates with its design the great change that the well-known brand is facing. The Jeep Avenger is a true European, and it has so many good features that it is a very satisfied jury that stands behind the title: Car of the Year 2023. Congratulations!”  “The Jeep Avenger has proved to be a perfect combination for most uses: it is compact and agile for city use, has enough power and torque to navigate any kind of road, and a good range even for medium-range trips. Even though it’s just 4.08m long, there’s plenty of room inside. It is a complete car, not a city car. But above all, it has a design that rocks” said Alberto Sabbatini, vice president: Car of the Year organisation. “We’re honored and proud that this distinguished jury of European automotive experts, has chosen the first-ever Jeep brand fully-electric SUV as European Car of the Year,” said Christian Meunier, Jeep brand CEO.
