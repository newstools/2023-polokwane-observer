The matter was reported to the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation Unit in Polokwane and an undercover operation was conducted,” his statement read. Maluleke said the suspect is a Chief Financial Officer at the Lepelle Nkumpi Local Municipality who met the complainant in her vehicle near a restaurant in the Polokwane CBD and the money was paid. “Her attempt to flee from the Hawks was futile as she was chased, cornered and arrested before she could disappear on to the streets of Polokwane. The money that she had received, as well as the vehicle that was used during the commission of the alleged offence, were confiscated,” he said.
