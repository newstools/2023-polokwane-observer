LIMPOPO – What was supposed to be a happy New Year’s eve celebration for the Phandavhudzi family in Lwamondo-Lukau village outside Thohoyandou turned tragic when their 12-bedroomed house caught fire in the early hours of the morning. Lorraine Rambelani-Phandavhudzi (54), said on the eve of the incident she and six of her children went to Tshilivho village near Ha-Makhuvha to attend a New Year’s eve vigil at the local church. “Everything was fine until we received a call at 5:30 from the neighbours that my house was on fire. Everything that was inside the house, including a plasma television, two refrigerators and four beds were engulfed in the flames and only ashes remained,” she said. The neighbours had apparently tried to douse the flames, but to no avail. “It was just lucky because no one was at home at the time of the incident. We have not yet established what might have caused the fire,” Phandavhudzi said.
