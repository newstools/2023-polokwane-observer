LIMPOPO – On April 18, 2020, Phineas Tswaledi Matsepane (62) was killed in his home in Ditwebeleng village under Mecklenburg policing area outside Sekhukhune. The incident occurred during an alleged house robbery, during which four armed criminals entered the house through the dining room door which was unlocked and made their way to the main bedroom where Matsepane, his wife and their three-year-old child slept. The group ordered them to lie down on the floor, covered them with blankets and threatened to burn them with an iron if they don’t comply to their demands. “In total the robbers took Matsepane’s firearm, R31 000 in cash, two cellphones, two plasma TV sets, as well as car keys,” Colonel Malesela Ledwaba confirmed in a statement.
