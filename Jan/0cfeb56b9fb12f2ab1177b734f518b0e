The Haval Tank 300 HEV, scored a five-star award from Australasia’s independent voice on vehicle safety, ANCAP. Broken down, the detail of the award reflects as follows: Adult Occupant Protection 88%, Child Occupant Protection 89%, Vulnerable Road User Protection 81%, and Safety Assist 85%. This, said Haval, will present the Tank 300 as a confident and durable luxurious 4×4 option within its class.  “Normally, perceptions for such boxy 4x4s are more focused on the terrain performance. However, GWM’s Tank 300 can offer both performance and safety at the same time, thanks to great engineering efforts put into the structure and tech level of this beast,” said Parker Shi, head of the overseas division of GWM. “GWM’s Tank 300 is launched with a hybrid model to show that the commitment of GWM’s electrification strategy roll-out is solid,” Shi added. And yes, the Tank will be released in South Africa this year. Source: QuickPic
