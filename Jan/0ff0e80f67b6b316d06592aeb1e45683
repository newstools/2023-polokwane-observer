Mercedes-Benz has announced its intention to support youth development through a global funding initiative that will see thousands of scholars exposed to environmental programmes and projects. To fund this, it will auction the world’s most valuable car – a 1955 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, for a record price of €135 million. The DO School Fellowships, a German non-profit organisation, developed the concept for beVisioneers and is now implementing it. Following a first call for fellow applications in January 2023, beVisioneers will be launched in June 2023 with an initial cohort of fellows from India, South Africa, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the UK). Applications can be made via the website www.bevisioneers.world. “As a global company and luxury brand, our responsibility does not end at our factory gates. Donating proceeds from the auction of the 300 SLR Uhlenhaut Coupé, the most valuable car in history gives us the opportunity to support something even more valuable – sustainable change. beVisioneers aims to create a relevant impact, one that benefits its young participants, their local communities and the environment. We are very proud to fund this unique initiative, which empowers a new and diverse generation of innovators. We wish all fellows every success as they make their visions a reality,” – Renata Jungo Brüngger, member of the board of management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG for Integrity and Legal Affairs beVisioneers will scale up to support up to 1 000 young people in the age group 16 to 28. Prospects will have to present a viable project idea that has the potential to make a measurable positive impact on the environment, ideally, on the applicant’s local community. The DO School experts will provide the fellows with a comprehensive 12-month intensive training and skills development programme focused on leadership, entrepreneurship and sustainability.
