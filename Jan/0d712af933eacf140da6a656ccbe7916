Rahul Van Manen won a gold medal in the junior men’s epee category as well as in the junior men’s foil. Rising young fencer Safiya Khan Patel walked away with a bronze medal in junior women’s foil. Legendary fencer and chairperson of Limpopo Fencing Association, Renuka Ramroop annexed a silver and bronze medal in veterans epee and foil categories. Sello Maduma, coach of the academy said they hope to win more medals in the events lined up for this year. “I would like to congratulate our medalists from the academy and to those who did not win medals – all the best for next time. A special word of encouragement goes to our fencers who participated outside of the province for the first time. This is the first of many competitions and I have no doubt they will go from strength to strength.” Maduma added they opened their academy on January 9 to prepare for national and international fencing events. “Most of the fencers reported for training on Monday. We are still waiting for fencers from the University of Limpopo. They will join after reopening of the universities. Our wish this year is to see all fencers from the academy doing well at every event and winning medals.”
