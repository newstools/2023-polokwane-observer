Lamb ribs may be a difficult cut of meat to find, but any butcher who sells lamb will be able to provide you with lamb ribs. We prefer single ribs because they cook faster, but a whole rack will do just as well. Spiced with cardamom pods, chilli powder, garlic, honey, tamarind paste, nutmeg and masala, this recipe by Instant Pot is sure to be a family favourite.
