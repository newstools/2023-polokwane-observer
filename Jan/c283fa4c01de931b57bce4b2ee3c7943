The Mahindra of yesteryear is not the Mahindra of today, and because of its value proposition, its popularity is skyrocketing. Officially it is now the fastest-growing brand in South Africa. The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa announced this in a report in December. Mahindra’s sales volumes in 2022 increased by 78% as compared to 2021. The report also shows that Mahindra’s passenger sales are up 80% and light commercial sales 77%. The Mahindra Pik Up was the fastest-growing bakkie brand on the market. The XUV300 is the safest car in Africa as tested by the Global New Car Assessment Programme. “Our sales success in 2022 and our title as South Africa’s fastest-growing vehicle brand can be attributed to our entire network, including our assembly plant in Durban that had to make do with component shortages and our dealers who supported customers on our waiting list,” says Rajesh Gupta, the CEO of Mahindra South Africa. On the whole, the auto industry had a much better year than in 2021. “We believe that we are now seeing the fruit of these long-term investments, and of making South Africa our second home outside India. We are proud to be a part of the South African landscape and of contributing to the local economy,” he concluded. Source: QuickPic
