Hino South Africa is no stranger to winning awards. In fact, it seems this has become a habit. 2022 will probably be remembered within Hino’s history books as one of its most difficult production years. Data Track conducts quarterly surveys since 1989. It interviews customers of fleet operators. The intent is to determine the quality of aftersales service provided by a manufacturer. Its survey showed that Hino excelled in terms of both sales and technical categories, scoring full marks. “Both these achievements are wonderful tributes to our loyal dealer network and the support staff at Hino South Africa, as well as the ongoing backup we continue to receive from Hino Japan in line with its global Total Support Programme,” commented Pieter Klerck, general manager of Hino SA. This is the first time Hino has scored 100% in two categories, sales and service, while its average score of 99.42 is the third highest it has achieved in the overall scoring, following scores of 99.79 and 98.6 in the third and second quarters of 2021 respectively. Hino scored 98.27 in the parts category in the fourth quarter of 2022. Source: MotorPress
