Our take on this classic South American starter involves accenting with grapefruit, and garnishing with avocado and citrus pickled red onions. We recommend pairing this with the recently launched Good Natured Organic Sauvignon Blanc 2022. With citrus, litchi and elderflower flavours culminating in a crisp finish, this certified organic wine is the perfect match for the cevicheâ€™s beguiling layers of acidity. Recipe by Spier.
