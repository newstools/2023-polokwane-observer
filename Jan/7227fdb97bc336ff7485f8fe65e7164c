And it benefits you in the following ways, according to scientists: – Improved physical and mental health – Improved self esteem – Less aggression – More empathy for people – Improved sleep – Reduced anxiety  According to research, people who practice gratitude are more optimistic, humble, and more satisfied with their lives. Their relationships show more depth and empathy. This applies to the workplace too. Employees who feel their work is appreciated, and their opinion valued, tend to work hard and feel good about themselves. To integrate gratitude in our lives, we must be intentional. We need to slow down so that we can appreciate what we have. Try these four tips from The Harvest Table to start your gratitude journey: 1. Savouring walk: Take a daily walk and actively notice all the things around you that are pleasing. Feel the sun on your face and the wind on your skin. Notice the design of the houses and the textures and colours of nature around you. 2. Meditate: Whether it is deep meditation or yoga – there are many ways to renew your mind. Focus on the people, and the things you are grateful for. 3. Gratitude journal: Write down the things you are grateful for every day.
