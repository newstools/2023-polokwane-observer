LIMPOPO – Popular comedian Livhuwani Madadzhe (38), also known as SABC Livhu, abandoned his bail application in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court today (January 31) following his arrest for the murder of his wife Lendelani Nengovela (33). Madadzhe was arrested on Saturday (January 28) after Nengovela’s remains were found in a water-filled pit toilet hole in their yard in Mangodi Ha Sidou, a day after she withdrew a domestic violence case against him. According to police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the couple were in a sour relationship and that Nengovela had opened a case of domestic violence against Madadzhe and he was arrested. “The suspect was out on bail and was to appear in court this week. The deceased then withdrew the case on Friday (January 27),” he explained. Mojapelo said Madadzhe called the police the following morning and reported that he could not locate his wife, but was surprised to find her dead in a pit toilet hole in their yard. “Preliminary probes conducted by the police at the scene led to the arrest of the suspect on a charge of murder,” his statement read. NPA regional spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the matter was adjourned to February 23 for further investigation. Madadzhe remains in custody.
