Toyota has sold 132 035 vehicles in 2022 and with this confirmed its 24.9% market share and dominance of 43 years as the people’s favourite car. The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) observed the following: “Following a robust recovery in the 2021 domestic new vehicle market, increasing year-on-year by 22.2% to 464 493 units compared to the severely Covid-19-affected 380 206 units in 2020, aggregate new vehicle sales recovered further by 13.9% to 528 963 units in 2022, but still 1.4% below the pre-pandemic 536 612 units sold in 2019.” Commenting on automotive retail figures of 2022, Naamsa says new vehicle sales are a good barometer of the domestic economy’s health. The association noted: “Following a fairly upbeat first quarter 2022 industry performance, global supply chain disruptions and the impact of the devastating floods in KwaZulu-Natal elevated inflation, an upward trend in interest rates, record fuel prices, as well as record highs in the frequency and intensity of load-shedding, weighed heavily on both business and consumer confidence. However, the new vehicle market’s performance in 2022 remained resilient despite the multiple national and international headwinds.”  Hilux once again proved the top performer, with 2 556 units sold. Corolla Cross sold 1 834. Other top performers in the group included the Starlet with 1 036, the Fortuner with 705 and the Urban Cruiser with 945. A total of 275 Hino units were sold, while Lexus recorded a total of 75 models. “We are truly grateful for the 26.9% market share recorded in December. We are also grateful to the entire Toyota South Africa Motors [TSAM] team and dealers across the country for their continued efforts towards making Toyota a market leader, but we have learnt from last year that we cannot be complacent. We emerged out of a tragedy and managed to achieve an overall market share of 24.9% in 2022 – and that’s phenomenal,” said the senior vice president of sales and marketing at TSAM, Leon Theron.
