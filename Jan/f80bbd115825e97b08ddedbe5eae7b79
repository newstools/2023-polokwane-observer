POLOKWANE – Thousands of men and women in blue are expected in Polokwane from tomorrow (January 25) ahead of National Police Day. The city will play host to a number of activities by the South African Police Service (SAPS) this week that will conclude with the national excellence awards. The awards ceremony which will be hosted at the Ranch Resort on Saturday (January 28) aims to celebrate and honour both operational and administrative employees including reservists who have gone beyond the call of duty to serve and protect South Africa. Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the week will kick off with the SAPS Career Expo at the Seshego Stadium on Wednesday (January 25). “Various experts from the SAPS divisions and units will showcase careers and expertise that exist within the organisation and the community at large and learners are encouraged to come and interact with various experts to learn a thing or two about what we do,” he said. The SAPS Golf Day will follow on Thursday (January 26) and all proceeds will go to the children of members who died in the line of duty. “This will be followed by National Police Day celebrations at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Friday (January 27) where members from all nine provinces will gather to acknowledge the outstanding contribution and sacrifice the men and women in blue make in their quest to ensure a safe and secure South Africa,” Mojapelo said. He added that both the Minister General Bheki Cele and the Deputy Minister Cassel Mathale will be joined by the SAPS top management led by the National Commissioner General Fannie Masemola as celebrations continue.
