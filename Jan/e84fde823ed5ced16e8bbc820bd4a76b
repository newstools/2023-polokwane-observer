The first race of the season of the Passion for Speed Series starts at Zwartkops Raceway on January 27 and 28. This year will also include some international entries, which, everyone believes, will really spice up the competition. Some of the many special cars that will be on track are a wild orange 7-litre Chevy V8-powered Can Am McLaren M6C, a couple of true blue Le Mans Ford GT40s and several other thrilling attractions among the overseas contingent. They will be alongside local GT40s, Porsche 917s and Lola T70s, Trans Am Chevy Camaros, Ford Mustangs and more.  This series has its roots in the legendary Piper Series, which guarantees a thrill a minute and spectators are kept glued to their seats.
