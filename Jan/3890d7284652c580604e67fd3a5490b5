When you look in the mirror and jump back in fright at your face ravaged by dull, red, dry, flaky and/or lined skin, it’s time for action. Many of us presume moisture and hydration is the same thing. But, who knew, there is a difference between them. Hydration, and hydrating products, focus on getting moisture into the skin, attracting it from the external environment. Moisturisation is the key to maintaining it. Moisturising helps to protect the skin barrier so that none of that precious water is lost. When to moisturise or hydrate? You need a moisturiser when skin is dry, flaky, red and irritated. People who have dry skin are also more likely to experience psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis. The skin is actually struggling to keep moisture locked in, often due to damage to the skin barrier. You can strengthen the skin barrier by using products containing hyaluronic acids. Dehydrated skin is easier to treat because it is often a temporary state caused by a loss of water. This gives rise to changes in the skin’s appearance because, starved of water, the skin battles to get rid of toxins. Signs of dehydration are dullness, itchiness, an increase in the noticeability of wrinkles and fine lines, (horrors), and an appearance of dark, under-eye circles.  What to do? Go-to products to get you started Opt for gentle, plant-based beauty products – always. Ingredients are important as some are more proficient at attracting water to the skin than others. No matter your skin type, a blend of moisturisation and hydration gives a smooth, blemish-free skin and a far happier mirror image experience.
