POLOKWANE – Players at Noordelikes Rugby Club were hard at work from January 7 preparing for the Limpopo Senior Rugby League matches set to start in April. Noordelikes will contest the league title with their counterparts from Potgietersrus Rugby Club, Louis Trichardt Rugby Club, Kruinies, Letaba and Messina Rugby club. According to Johan van Ravesteyn, the deputy president at Noordelikes and head of business at the club, this season they want to build a team that can challenge the league. “We practise every Tuesday evening at the club in Ladanna. We have a good team of young players that have been with us in the past seasons. We want to have a strong team that can challenge the league.” He also said they are aware of the threat that is the Potgietersrus Rugby Club, who won the title in past seasons. “They are a strong team and a force to be reckoned with, with experienced players. It is going to be tough playing against them but we will give our best. We will have practice matches in February and March on our home ground in Ladanna to keep the players fit and ready for the league matches.”
