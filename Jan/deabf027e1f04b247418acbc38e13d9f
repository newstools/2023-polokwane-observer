POLOKWANE – The sitting councilor of Ward 10 in Polokwane says paying attention to the needs of residents and providing lasting solutions is the reason behind his win during last week’s by-election. The tight run between the EFF, ANC and Action SA on January 25 saw Jacob Seshoka lead with 1445 votes and the EFF retaining the ward. The ANC got 1293 votes while Action SA received 292 votes. Seshoka says the party had to be resolute with the water crisis faced by the ward and donated five water tankers at key points, including Dairing Extension, Peter Nchabeleng, Blood River and two of them in a significantly large area called Makgofe. These, according to him, are short term interventions. In the run up to the 2024 national elections and provided they win the elections the EFF, with his aid, plan on using the multiple borehole systems already set up in some areas struggling with water, to erect taps in each of the houses. However, clean drinkable water is not the only baggage faced by the residents. Poverty and drug use compels the EFF to provide groceries to the elderly in the areas of the ward along with blankets and shoes, especially in the winter. “Since 2016, we have consistently provided all of these necessities and continue helping the community with subsistence farming and provide seeds for them to sustain their families,” he told Bonus. The area was under the EFF’s administration before the by-election which was prompted by the death of the previous ward councillor, Doris Photo in October 2022. Meanwhile, to the relief of the Independent Electoral Commission, Limpopo’s electoral officer, Nkaro Mateta said there were no irregularities reported or dissatisfaction with the poll turnout.
