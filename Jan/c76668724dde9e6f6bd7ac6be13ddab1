Parking a large SUV or double-cab bakkie is not without its challenges, and when space is tight or the driver in the adjacent parking pulls in like a fool, you may well get a little hot under the collar. Of course, you can just leave your car at home, but in South Africa with its lack of public transport, this is a pipe dream for most. To solve this dilemma, the German Association of the Automobile Industry collaborated with Ford to develop and demonstrate the value of vehicle infrastructure-connected communication. This will find a parking space and park the car. It is called Automated Valet Parking and will enable drivers to use an app to send the vehicle into an automated parking manoeuvre â€“ all from outside the vehicle. This technology will increase the parking capacity of all car parks, as it will park cars close to one another without the possibility of damage.  How it works Upon arriving at the car park, the driver leaves the vehicle in a designated area and uses the FordPass app to start the automated guidance to a free parking space. Drivers use the FordPass app to request the return of the vehicle to the designated area, expediting the pick-up experience and enabling the driver and passengers to comfortably enter the vehicle.
