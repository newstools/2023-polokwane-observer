POLOKWANE – The transition from primary to high school is a taxing experience for both learners and their parents. However, educational psychologist Bokgabo Motlatso says there are ways to ease both parties into it and shares tested advice to parents whose children will be starting high school in 2023. Motlatso said parents need to foster and focus on building good study habits for success in future grades. “Starting early will help your child practice good study habits such as organizational time management before he/she enters high school, while building studying resilience. Understanding a child’s learning pace will also allow parents to manage the time needed to do homework and find weak areas that need educational support,” Motlatso said. This will allow for parents to place early intervention in place through extra tuition or remedial lessons. Get organised Buy your child a high school starter pack. This comprises of a school backpack, stationary, the correct school uniform and a diary or notebook. Teach your child to take notes This will remove the pressure of forgetting. Add in a lunchbox Fill the lunchbox with nutritious food and a treat. “A loving and encouraging message, something as small as ‘Dad is proud of you – be great! See you later!’ can go a long way for your child. Motlatso said exercise and sports are also great for physical well-being and health. “Actively promote these activities, even if your child is not first in the team. Reward their participation and exchange words of positivity, encouragement and commitment.”
