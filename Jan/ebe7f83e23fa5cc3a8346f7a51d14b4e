POLOKWANE – More than 1 000 athletes are expected to participate in the 2023 edition of the Capricorn District Municipality 4-in-1 Marathon and Comrades qualifier, scheduled for Peter Mokaba Stadium on February 25. This is according to CDM Mayor, Mamedupi Teffo who made the announcement during the launch of the event on January 12. The race will start at 06:00 and end at the stadium, and registrations will be done at the Polokwane Athletic Club (PAC) offices at the stadium on February 22-23 from 09:00-18:00. Teffo said the marathon aims to encourage a healthy lifestyle among citizens and to enhance and promote social cohesion, promote nation building and a national identity. She mentioned that the marathon proved to be an example of how a sporting event can promote the district and contribute to local economic development in respect of the rich tourism offers for residents and visitors. “Regardless of who crosses the finish line first, this race is an inspiration, and we look forward to all athletes showing the spirit of determination to give their all. We invite the public to register early, and for spectators to come and cheer on the athletes, for family members to join their runners, and also friends to come and be with us.” PAC Chairperson Corrie Calitz said athletes will contest for the top honours in 5km, 10km, 21km and 42km. “We urge athletes to register on time. There will be emergency medical services on all routes to attend to those who might need attention and there will be a recovery area where finishers will receive post-event help such as drinks and various products from sponsors.” Twelfth-time Comrades Marathon runner Maropeng Rocky Mojela was announced as the ambassador of the race. Mojela is expected to drive the 42km bus, estimated to run for four hours and 35 minutes. “I look forward to more passengers on the bus. Everyone is welcome to join the bus, it is going to be exciting. I am urging more runners to register and come and join the fun.”
