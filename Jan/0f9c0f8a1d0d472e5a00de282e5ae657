LIMPOPO – What started out as a social media chat group gained momentum in a short while, with the Vhembe Emerging Farmers (VEF) chat group having grown to more than 60 members. The group’s members say they continue to disprove those who say that youths are lazy and know nothing about farming. According to VEF chairperson, Ndivhuwo Thato Mukhwantheli the need to make a collective effort started during the Covid-19 pandemic. “As farmers, we were struggling to visit other farms to learn something from them. Fortunately, a wise man decided to combine farmers from the Vhembe district through a chat group where we shared the challenges we were facing with our livestock. As with any party, it does have protocols to be followed. We have people who own different breeds of livestock like goats, sheep, cattle, pigs, chickens, rabbits, and agriculture products as there’s no discrimination and we are here to help each other,” Mukhwantheli remarked.
