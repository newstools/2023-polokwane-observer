In 2022 the VW Polo, the Vivo, and the T-Cross accounted for 74% of VWs being sold. “This accounts for 16.4% market share in 2022,” said Steffen Knapp, the head of the Volkswagen Passenger Car Brand. The Kariega manufacturing plant exported 8 942 more vehicles in 2022, compared to 2021, while Volkswagen exported 98 315 Polos to 38 international countries. “Our T SUV family is growing from strength to strength. In 2022, T-Cross sales increased by 38% compared to 2021. The T-Cross is not only Volkswagen’s best-selling imported vehicle, but it is also one of the best-selling vehicles in the competitive A0 SUV segment,” concluded Knapp.  Other VW models that did well were the Taigo with 1 885, T-Roc with 2 407 and the Tiguan range sold 2 613 units during the same time. The Golf range is as popular as ever with 639 units sold in 2022. The new Amarok, Golf 8 R, Tiguan TDi, T-Cross Trendline and others will bolster the VW range in 2023. Source: QuickPic
