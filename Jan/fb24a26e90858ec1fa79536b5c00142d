POLOKWANE – Nutritionist Mihlali Maraga says healthy lunchboxes keep kids active, alert and focused in class and gives them the nutrition they need. “Lunch boxes can be exciting and enticing if you keep them varied by including colourful food from the different food groups to avoid your child getting bored of the same food every day. Make it look appetising and interesting. Give your child green grapes, apple slices or strawberries and a sandwhich with bread a low-fat butter, cucumber and cheese for taste or even hard-boiled eggs which are an excellent source of lean protein,” she said. She added that you can also include snacks such as crackers or a wholesome muffin with water instead of juice as they tend to have lots of sugar. “If your children love vegetables, give them small portions of potatoes and sweet potatoes. Perhaps a potato salad with mayo-light. Add this to their lunch box as their starch once a week. Other great starch options are grains or rice and maybe add white-meat poultry such as chicken or turkey breasts,” she said. To conclude the lunchbox for school, your child should have the following in their lunchbox:
• One or two fresh fruits.
• Any two vegetables of their choice.
• At least two healthy proteins.
• Any two whole grain and incorporate it with dairy products if the children desire. “Remember to always make their food look good as well. For example, cut the bread into shapes, use blackberries for eyes, a carrot for a nose and maybe a half cucumber to make a mouth. Play around with the design and you’ll see how your child will enjoy their healthy lunch box.”
