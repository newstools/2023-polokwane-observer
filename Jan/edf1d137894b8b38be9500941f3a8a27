There is a good reason why mushrooms make for the perfect Meat-free Monday dish. Umami-rich mushrooms are an excellent nutrient-rich food that is low in calories, cholesterol, and sodium, and they provide plenty of fiber and flavor. But the big news is that they contain robust amounts of antioxidants, selenium, riboflavin, Vitamin D, and other healthful substances that protect the immune system and may even fight cancer. Today’s recipe by The South African Mushroom Farmers’ Association combines two South African favourites – avocados and button mushrooms – for a tasty dish full of earthy flavour. So satisfying and ready in just minutes! Fill desired glass with ice and add the pomegranate and a few slices of fresh chilli. Pour in the Cape Fynbos Gin and top with tonic. The botanicals found along the coast of the Western Cape make wonderful accompaniments to light dishes and summertime suppers. Packed full of these Cape botanicals, Cape Fynbos Gin is the perfect match for this zesty dish of mushroom stuffed avocados. The rich mouth feel of the avocado is cut perfectly by the clean and herbaceous notes found in the Cape Fynbos Gin.
