Honda recently announced its 14-man Franchise Co Sleepover Tork Craft team that will participate in the Trademore South African Nationals as well as the GXCC Gauteng regionals. The premier 450cc OR1 class will be contested by Mike Pentecost, Gareth Cole and Hayden Louw on Honda CRF 450 RXs. Their intention is to repeat their 2022 open class OR1 1-2-3 in pure Honda red. The OR3 attack will include Haydn Cole, John Botha, Tyron Beverley and Noah Maartens riding on Honda CRF 250 RXs. Wynand Delport and Gerhard Vorster will fly the Franchise Co Sleepover Tork Craft Honda flag in the senior class. Warrick van Schalkwyk will compete in the master’s class. Third in last year’s championship, Murray Smith and the ever-quick Jaden Els will don the red in 85 Senior, while Liam Scheepers is the lad in red in 85 Junior. “There’s nothing small about our 2023 attack. We have a bigger and far stronger team to do the business. The Red Rockets are back in force in South African cross-country racing, and we will be fighting to win,” said the team’s boss, Harry Grobler. The 2023 GXCC Gauteng Cross Country Championship commences with the opening round at Lekoa Lodge at Villiers, just across the Vaal River on Saturday, January 28, before the Trademore South African Cross Country Championship kicks off at Legends in Rhino Park, Pretoria, on March 4.
