POLOKWANE – The city’s Independent Examinations Board (IEB) schools are celebrating this morning (January 18) with the release of the 2022 NSC results. Mitchell House and PEPPS recorded 100% pass rates for the class of 2022 and bragging rights in the form of distinctions, while Curro Heuwelkruin recorded a 97.6% pass rate. Mitchell House’s head of college, Claude Goeminne was quoted to have said that the focus and determination of the learners also meant that they improved on earlier performances this year and produced the best set of results for 2022. The 2022 NSC pass rate for IEB schools is 98.42%, which is slightly higher than last year’s pass rate of 98.39%. According to a press release, all candidates who passed achieved a pass that grants access to tertiary study at one of the three levels: “The performance of the 2022 cohort of students has been outstanding. There is enough credible research on the impact of Covid-19 on the educational aspects of children to  provide insight into where we are at, in coming out of the pandemic almost three years later. It is fair to say that it is the 2022 cohort of learners that were hardest hit by the impact of the pandemic when it broke in 2020 in their Gr 10 year,” IEB CEO Anne Oberholzer said. She added that the Class of 2022 missed out the most in their Gr 10 and 11 years which are fundamental to their success in their Gr 12 performance.
