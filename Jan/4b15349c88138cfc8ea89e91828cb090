LIMPOPO – Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, along with the deputy provincial commissioner responsible for crime detection, Major General Samuel Manala, and the Vhembe district commissioner, Major General Eddie Van der Walt visited Lamvi village under the Makuya policing area yesterday (January 4). The visit was conducted to show their support to the family of seven-year-old Washu Tshihume, who went missing on December 24, a day before Christmas. “I know this is a very difficult situation for everyone, especially the parents, but I promise the police will leave no stone unturned to find the child and discover what really transpired. We therefore call on community members in this area to assist the police in searching for the child,” Hadebe said. He added that he assembled an investigating team dedicated to track down the boy. “The case is driven by the Provincial Investigation Unit who have been working non-stop to locate Washu, who reportedly went missing while playing with his friends near his home,” Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed in a statement. The visiting officials urged residents to refrain from taking the law into their own hands and to allow the police the needed time and space to investigate the matter thoroughly. “When I arrived here this morning, I was told that a house was torched last night. Nothing can justify anyone to take the law into their own hands as this behavior is a criminal act and the police will be obliged to act against the culprits. I urge everyone to desist from engaging in any form of criminality as this will not help to find the child,” Hadebe concluded. Anyone with information regarding the missing child may contact the investigating officers; Lieutenant Colonel Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501, Warrat Officer Phaladi Makola on 071 601 5174 or Sergeant Thulani Baloyi on 072 228 2680. Alternatively, they may call the crime stop number on 08600 10111, the nearest police station or use MySAPSApp.
