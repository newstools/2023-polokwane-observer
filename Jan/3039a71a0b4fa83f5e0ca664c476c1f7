Lamborghini and Bridgestone have partnered to provide even more status to an already phenomenal car – the Huracán Sterrato. Bridgestone will provide all-terrain rubber for the V10-fitted super sports car. The new Bridgestone Dueler All-Terrain AT002 tyre offers drivers maximum on-road and off-road performances. The tyre’s bespoke polymers, patterns and technologies have been developed to enhance the all-terrain capabilities of the Huracán Sterrato and maximise the thrill and fun of driving on and off the asphalt. These tyres offer run-flat technology (RFT). The tyre also provides a specific shoulder integrated for additional grip in deep gravel and mud.  Steven de Bock, vice president of consumer replacement and operations executive at Bridgestone Europe, Middle-East, India and Africa, said, “With the Dueler All-Terrain AT002, Bridgestone has created a bespoke tyre that perfectly complements the high-speed all-terrain concept of the Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato. We’ve created a tyre that is just as capable at high speeds on asphalt as it is when driving off-road, providing high-speed stability and off-road capability, rising to meet a completely different set of challenges on mud, gravel, and demanding terrains.” Source: MotorPress
