Car buyers are spoilt for choice, so innovation and superb aftersales service seem to be the one element with which vehicle brands and dealers can really differentiate themselves from the next supplier. Mitsubishi has launched a number of new and updated products during 2022, so it has become imperative for them to focus on customer service in an effort to increase sales throughout the product range. “Mitsubishi understands that the dealer network is the heartbeat of the business and will be increasing the dealer network. A sales force retention programme is also in development to assist with attracting and retaining quality salespeople,” said Jeffrey Allison, general manager of marketing at Mitsubishi Motors South Africa (MMSA). “In recognition of the significance of our dealer network, we have improved the contribution to dealer income and strive to offer a stable and consistent stock supply across our range. As a celebration of our dealer network, we will reintroduce the dealer of the year and diamond club,” said Allison.  Mitsubishi believes that recovery in the supply chain may well produce an oversupply of vehicles. And considering the rise in the fuel price, rate increases and raw material, it may lead to an increase in vehicle prices. However, the spending power of consumers will curb spending money on luxury items. “Despite these challenges, Mitsubishi Motors South Africa believes there is still room for growth in the segments that we compete in, and will continue to offer our customers the latest in terms of product while sticking true to the values that make Mitsubishi products what they are,” Allison concluded.
