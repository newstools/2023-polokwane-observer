It is all green and go for the Kawasaki cross-country motorcycle team, with Kenny Gilbert setting the pace. Pepson Plastics Factory Kawasaki jump-started its GXCC Gauteng Championship intentions at the Lekoa Lodge this past Saturday, with two wins and two second places. South African seniors’ champion Kenny Gilbert has been unbeaten for more than a year, and he dominated the senior race with a handy ninth overall among the best of the young guns after another faultless ride in the sandy, rocky Free State terrain. Brian Bontekoning made a fine GXCC Cross Country debut with a maiden veterans class victory astride his Pepson Plastics Factory Kawasaki. He was backed up by team boss Iain Pepper, who rode home fifth in the class for the oldest riders in cross-country racing. Young Jake Pretorius rode home second in the U13 85cc juniors. Wian Wentzel stepped up to OR3 with a fine debut fourth in the ultra-competitive 250cc class. “It was a positive start to the new season,” Pepper confirmed. “Kenny continued his winning streak, Brian arrived with a bang, and Jake, Jaycee and Wian delivered great results. The rest of us enjoyed a mixed day. Everyone got home safely and we all had a ball.” Source: MotosportMedia / Photos: Action in Motion
