The New MEGANE R.S. 300 TROPHY personifies excitement and all-round driveability whether you drive it to town, the open road, or on the track. The exterior boasts an F1 styled bumper, sharkfin antenna, LED headlights and 19-inch alloys, among other features. The Alcantara seats are finished with racy red top-stitching.  The Trophy is powered by a 1.8 litre, 221kW/420Nm engine that will take you from 0 to 100km/h in 5.7 seconds and topping out at a whopping 260km/h. This is impressive and so are the Brembo callipers that provide the stopping power for a car fitted with a race ready suspension and limited slip differential – all with the intention to provide exceptional cornering and traction for a thrilling drive.  The vibrant and connected driver also has access to an interactive Renault multimedia system including a 7-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth, USB and AUX input and includes Smart phone replication i.e., Apple Car Play and Android Auto.
