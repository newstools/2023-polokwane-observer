The Simola Hillclimb in Knysna has built a reputation for action, colour, and racing noise second to none and is well-deserving of its premier racing event status. And because of the latter, the earlier you submit your entry, the better. In fact, entry into this 13th edition of the event closes on January 31st. Total entries are limited to 84 with only 65 entries into Classic Car Friday competition. “We’ve had a fantastic response from our regular competitors as well as newcomers to the event since the applications opened in October last year, and there’s no doubt that we will have a spectacular line-up this year,” says sporting director Geoff Goddard. “The calibre of entries is exceptional, and it’s remarkable how much time and effort is spent on these cars, many of which are specifically built or prepared just to compete at the Simola Hillclimb. “I’m delighted that we are also seeing increased interest from the vehicle manufacturers and importers, which further entrenches the Simola Hillclimb’s status as one of the must-attend automotive events of the year,” Goddard says. All entries will be reviewed after the closing date to ensure that they comply with the strict regulations of the event. Although the Simola Hill course is but 1.9 km long, it provides all the challenges one can expect of a full-blooded hillclimb event.
