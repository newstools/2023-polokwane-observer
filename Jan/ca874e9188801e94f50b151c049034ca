LIMPOPO – A young man who was reported missing on December 25, a day before his wedding, has been reunited with his family in Ngovhela village outside Thohoyandou. His family, however, is concerned about his health. Avhantondi Richard Mushasha (35) was reported missing by his sister, Ndifelani Mushasha on Christmas Day. “When he first went missing, we conducted several searches with the help of the community, relatives, friends and police, without any success. At the time, we had already made preparations for his wedding day, but this had to be called off,” she told CV. She said her brother was eventually located in the Vuwani area on January 6 by the police after it was reported that he had been at a relative’s homestead. “We are not sure who took him from Ngovhela to Vuwani, but we are happy that he is alive. We are worried about his state of mind, as since he came back he had not recognised us all as family members. He also could not say where he had been for the past month.” Limpopo police spokesperson, Col Malesela Ledwaba confirmed that the police in Thohoyandou were investigating a missing person’s case but that Mushasha was later discovered at a relative’s house.
