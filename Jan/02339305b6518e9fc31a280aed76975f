It’s been 30 years since FAW launched in South Africa, and to celebrate its achievements and tremendous growth, it will also launch a number of new models. Its JH6 28.500FT claimed second place in the Focus Transport Truck Test in 2022, confirming the fuel efficiency of the FAW products. In 2023, FAW will expand both its dealer network and its product range to further cement its commitment to the South African market, and in this process, it will hopefully surpass 15 000 units of production. “The fact that there are plans in place to reach our 15 000th unit of production in such a short space of time, is purely based on demand for the product by local customers who value our built-in-Africa-for-Africa strategy,” said Yongjun Li, CEO of FAW Trucks South Africa. “2023 is set to be a massive year for FAW Trucks, and we look forward to celebrating our 30th year by continuing to deliver on our core values, while at the same time improving our offering in all areas, including manufacturing, the dealer network and our product offering,” he concluded.
