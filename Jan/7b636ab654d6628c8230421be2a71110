Air fryer shrimps are quick and simple to prepare, and they taste just as good, if not better, than your favourite restaurant appetiser. These healthier fried coconut shrimps are made in the air fryer with only a few ingredients and no need for a lot of oil. Cooking shrimps in the air fryer is quick and easy, wonderfully crispy and succulent, and so much better for you! Thank you Instant Pot for the recipe. Mango curry aioli
