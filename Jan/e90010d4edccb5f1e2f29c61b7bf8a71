Classic comfort foodâ€¦ with a spicy kick! Jalapeno poppers are a tasty snack that mixes the heat of jalapenos with crunchy garnish and a creamy, cheesy core. The poppers, which are often stuffed with cream cheese, have a rich taste that is wonderful on their own or coupled with dipping sauces. Recipe by Instant Pot.
