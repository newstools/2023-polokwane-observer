Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a very versatile oil as it can be used in both sweet or savoury dishes, and since the oil can withstand very high temperatures, it is ideal for any form of cooking. EVOO is unique in that the antioxidants and nutrients do not break down during the culinary process, therefore not only does it add nutritional value to any dish, but its natural compounds elevate and complement all other ingredients. Whether you choose to drizzle, dip, bake or fry with EVOO, be sure to look out for the CTC seal when purchasing your EVOO. This seal has been introduced by the SA Olive Industry and appears on olive oils of participating SA Olive members to ensure that the consumer chooses the best quality locally produced oils. To give you some inspiration, below are three tasty dishes by SA Olive for you to try using EVOO and olives. (Serves 4 for a delicious breakfast of light supper)
