MOKOPANE- Residents of Extension 19 face disaster every time there is heavy rainfall and it has gotten worse every year since 2009. Community members are discouraged, as every year the problem is reported to the municipality, and every time someone is sent out to take photos, but nothing is done, they say. One resident commented that they have to replace damaged furniture and appliances, and the only assistance they receive from the municipality, is food parcels. After each rainy season, the residents experience a lot of damages, but they have grown to expect it. The source of the problem is a stream of water that leads to a river bed that flows next to houses. When there is heavy rain, the stream fills up and causes a big problem as the water overflows into the houses. To make matters worse, there are multiple blocked and overflowing manholes in the area. The sewerage water mixes with the rain water, which then flows through the residents’ houses and it is a big health risks to the community. Bosveld and DA ward councillor Monique Maartens, as well as PR councillor Donald Patleswane visited Ext 19 recently. In some areas the roads are so bad that a vehicle cannot even gain access to the properties as the roads wash away. Some residents have been living in the area since 2008, and they are fed-up with the lack of service from the municipality. The residents said they don’t want to report the problem to the municipality anymore, because they do nothing regarding the problem. One of the residents can’t even park her vehicle at her house, because the road is so damaged. She has to parks a few kilometres away at a friend’s house and then walk home. Storm water pipes have been purchased a long time ago, but it is yet to be installed. Head of communications at the municipality, Malesela Selokela, urged residents to take their case numbers to the municipality for future investigation.
