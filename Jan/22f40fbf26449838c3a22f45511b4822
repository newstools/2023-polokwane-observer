Motorcycle sales are on the up. Does this come as a surprise? Fuel prices continue to rise and consumers are looking at alternative methods of transport. December 2022’s motorcycle sales are up 18.4% on December 2021, and this is well above even pre-Covid sales, says the national director of the Association of Motorcycle Importers and Distributors (AMID), Arnold Olivier. e-Commerce and the demand for delivery bikes and scooters are up by 29.5%.  The higher priced 500cc+ leisure segments decreased by 10%, whereas the leisure segment below 500cc grew by 39%. Off-road motorcycle sales, which is also a leisure segment, decreased by 12.3%. The quad market declined by 4%. Stock shortages also contributed to this decline. Electric two- and three-wheeled motorcycle sales are less than 150 units per annum, yet it grew by 135%. This is indicative of an ever-increasing interest in EVs. Used motorcycle sales statistics are not yet available for the last quarter of 2022, but a decline is expected. Viewed over a six-year period, annual used sales remain at roughly a 45 000 unit per annum level, which makes 2022 more or less in line. The 2022 sales results are therefore very good in some respects and disappointing in others, but importers remain positive that the growth pattern will continue in 2023 and beyond.
