LIMPOPO – Sally Sithole, founder of Sally Sithole Foundation, says the government needs to make provision for free school uniforms for indigent learners from schools in the rural villages in the province. There are a lot of learners from rural communities who stay away from school due to a lack of proper uniforms, she said. The 22-year-old philanthropist and mentor from Flora Park in Polokwane argues that if people can get free RDP houses and learners can get free stationery from the government, surely learners can receive free school uniforms too. “It would be ideal and I would love to see free school uniforms implemented in schools in need as soon as possible. It is painful to see learners going to school without proper shoes or a uniform during the rainy and cold days. This motion will enable the learners to enjoy their education without any hindrances. At public schools books are given for free to all the students, so why can’t the Department of Education make provision for school uniforms for the indigent learners. I know it might be a process which needs to be approved by the authorities, but if this wish come true it might help a lot of underprivileged children. Learners need to enjoy their educational journey and the government can help them in that regard,” Sithole said. Through her foundation, Sithole travels to various villages in the province where she assists learners to apply for bursaries for tertiary education, giving them a chance to better their future.
