POLOKWANE – Scores of runners from various athletic clubs in Polokwane, Seshego and Mankweng are expected to participate at the Makoro Village Marathon at Mamatsha Village in Ga-Molepo, Mankweng on March 18. The marathon is the brainchild of Polokwane Mayor John Mpe and he says through the marathon he wants to encourage people to explore and celebrate the village life, cultural heritage and tourism in the villages. “The race is run on the footsteps of Moria, the religious capital of South Africa. People coming from other provinces and areas will have the opportunity to explore Moria and the Wolkberg mountain range while running. The marathon will cater for 42km, 21km, 10km and 5km athletes. And for the first time the village marathon will be a Comrades qualifier. It’s not about who will win the race but about your participation and being part of a community.” He added that Polokwane has a good background in contribution towards sport development and activities in both urban and rural areas. “We take our marathons to all our clusters which mainly consist of rural areas. I will be running with Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba and Sport MEC Nakedi Sibanda as well as Capricorn Mayor Mamedupi Teffo and Lepelle-Nkumpi Mayor Meriam Molala.” Rocky Mojela, Comrades pace setter, who has participated in more than 12 Comrades Marathons will be driving the 21km bus in the marathon. “I have already started with the preparations and look forward to the event to help athletes finish the race.”
