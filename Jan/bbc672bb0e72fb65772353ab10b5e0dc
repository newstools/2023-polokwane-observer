The Haval Jolion HEV (hybrid electric vehicle) offers innovative technology that will hopefully expand the demand for affordable and luxury electric vehicles within a larger audience. Its 1.5-litre hybrid drivetrain can operate solely on either electric or petrol or a combination of the two to provide a seamless and economic performance. The Jolion HEV can seamlessly transfer between configurations such as EV, series hybrid, parallel hybrid and regeneration, depending on the driving conditions and driver input. Its total power output is 140kW and 375Nm and it promises a fuel index of as little as five litres per 100km, taking fuel consumption to a previously unimagined level. The driver is also able to tailor the power delivery experience via a variety of driving modes, including standard, eco, sports and snow. The steering wheel feel is customisable thanks to three dynamic adjustable steering modes.  Safety In the interests of safety, all Haval Jolion HEV models feature an electronic stability system, traction control, ABS and EBD.
