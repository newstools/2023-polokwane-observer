POLOKWANE – The Polokwane Athletic Club (PAC) in partnership with Volvo and Land Rover Polokwane and Henstock van den Heever Attorneys will host a 3-in-1 road race at Land Rover Polokwane on January 28. Expected at the event are 1 200 athletes from various clubs in the city as well as from neighbouring provinces. PAC chairman Corrie Calitz said the event will be a curtain raiser for other runs lined up for the year. “We are excited to host the event and I am certain that athletes are equally excited. We have invited all the athletic clubs in the province and the response was positive. This is the first race of the new year which will help the runners with fitness and preparations for other events this year.” He said runners can visit www.peaktiming.co.za to enter for the race. “We will have a 5km fun run for the families and children.
