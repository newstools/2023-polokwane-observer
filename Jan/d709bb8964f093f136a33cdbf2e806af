The SA Rally-Raid Championship is recognised as a premium off-road series and always attracts international participation. Malalane in Mpumalanga will host the first event on March 24 and 25. Twice a winner of the treasured Best Event of the Year title, the organisers, Malalane Toyota, with the Horn family as its trustees, will draw many local racing fans as well as present competitors with a challenging route. The second race will be the Sugarbelt 400 in Eston in KwaZulu-Natal on May 12 and 13. Following will be the TGRSA 1000 Desert Race in Botswana and Jwaneng. The dates are June 23 to 25. The fourth and fifth rounds will be held in Parys in the Free State on August 18 and 19. Welkom, also in the Free State, will, for the first time, welcome competitors for round six on October 6 and 7. The final event of the series will be run on November 10 and 11. A venue is still to be decided on. So, if you love excitement and adrenalin-generating sport, diarise these dates.  Source: Charmaine Fortune
