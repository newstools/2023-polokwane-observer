POLOKWANE – Manani Botes is a household name on the airwaves in Polokwane as she worked as presenter at a few local radio stations. This week she moved into her new studio at Mall of the North, reporting for Jacaranda FM. To celebrate this, Mall of the North management hosted a get-together with tenants and Jacaranda FM staff on Monday morning at Mugg & Bean. The station hosted a competition last year with a two-day auditioning session, to find the perfect presenter for the afternoon show. In November she received the call that she is the new presenter and in December the Jacaranda FM made the official announcement. “I expected it a little, but was super excited and happy.” Manani will be on air Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 12:00-16:00. She is part of the regional broadcast team with Barney Simon and Sascha van Gelder. One aim the station had for the new presenter, is to be unique and a curious storyteller, who can connect with their diverse listener landscape. The winner had wanted to be part of an extraordinary team, according to Jacaranda FM programming manager, Hennie Myburgh. Manani grew up in Limpopo and is fully bilingual and able to connect with her listeners on a personal level. “I am super excited and it was always a dream to become a presenter at a big station such as Jacaranda FM. It is also a privilege to work with the Jacaranda team.” Manani will be on the air at 94.2 and listeners are welcome to pass the studio on the upper level of the mall and say ‘hello’.
