LIMPOPO – For new learners to enjoy the first day of primary school and feel welcome at their respective new schools, teachers need to immediately acquaint themselves with new learner’s names and surnames. This is according to award-winning former teacher, principal and community builder, Phuti Ragophala. According to Ragophala, situations should always be avoided wherein teachers call learners by sarcastic nicknames because that could have a detrimental effect on a child’s emotional and psychological well-being. “Teachers must know the correct names and surnames of the learners on the first day of school to avoid confusion. The teachers must also take time to familiarise the learners so that they can feel comfortable with the school, the classes, the playing field, ablution and recreational facilities,” she said. She advised parents of the new learners to accompany their children on the first day of school and regularly attend the parent-teacher meetings. “Parents must not attend only certain meetings or undermine the school management. Every school meeting is very important. Parents should attend and support their children. It is also important for young learners to arrive with their parents on the first day of school. That gives a learner a sense of belonging and great comfort. Nothing beats parental support and I would like to see parents and guardians show that kind of appreciation to their children more regularly.” She further urged parents to pack fruits in their children’s lunch boxes rather than the traditional “heavy” meals. “They must pack only fruits and healthy snacks in children’s lunch boxes if the children attend a governmental school where lunch is provided. We don’t want kids to return home with a full lunch box because they were given a similar meal at school.”
