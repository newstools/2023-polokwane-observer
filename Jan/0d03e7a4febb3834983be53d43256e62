POLOKWANE – Birds tend to go unnoticed but when you take the time to actively notice them, you will be surprised at how many species there are. As someone who not only knows birds, but also loves them, Daniel Engelbrecht will open your eyes to how unique each bird is. Engelbrecht is one of South Africa’s top birders and will present a course on the different birds in Limpopo on Saturday, January 28. The course will be hosted at the Dries Abraham Lapa in the Polokwane Game Reserve from 08:30 – 15:30. Tea, coffee and biscuits will be served, but bring your own snack, water, lunch and other drinks. Apart from valuable information to be learnt, there will also be a bird ringing demonstration and its value explained. Organiser Lisa Grosel says the outing will assist in developing a new hobby. “The course will show you how to get started as a birder and introduce you to different bird groups. Birding is a fascinating, and sometimes crazy, hobby for young and old.” To book your place at only R100 per person, contact Lisa via email at lisa@tembele.co.za or via WhatsApp on 083 380 2300.
