Didn’t get a chance to get away in December? Now is your moment… and we’ve got just the place. Grab the family, invite your friends and head to one of the best rated locations in Plettenberg Bay: The Bungalow. Enjoy the good life at this 5-star Bed and Breakfast, just a stone’s throw from the water’s edge at Hobie Beach with expansive sea views, providing the ultimate experience in beachside living. Part of the Raw Africa Boutique Collection (formerly Cape Summer Villas Boutique Collection Collection), The Bungalow’s sophisticated interior offers seven, sea-facing, luxuriously furnished rooms with en-suite bathrooms along with all the bells and whistles. The addition of The Bungalow Beach Villa offers a further three apartments:  For basking in the summer sun, there are sea-facing, upper and lower restaurant viewing decks – the sprawling upper deck overlooks the entire bay, while the lower deck – sharing the spotlight with a trendy plunge pool – is shaded by beautiful indigenous Milkwood trees. Spend the evenings, relaxing at the tranquil, secluded, cozy fire boma area on the rock cliff-face side, perfect for intimate gatherings and entertaining. There are several other leisure areas where you can enjoy a catnap or a good book while relaxing to the soothing sounds of the waves breaking on the beach. The restaurant and bar, with its timeless design complementing the natural beauty of the beach and the warm Indian Ocean, offers an exceptional dining experience. Take advantage of the various water sports activities including swimming, surfing, whale watching, boating and fishing. Land lovers can look forward to cycling, golfing, hiking, nature walks and bird watching. The Robberg Nature Reserve is also close by and the Plettenberg Bay Airport is only 8kms away.
