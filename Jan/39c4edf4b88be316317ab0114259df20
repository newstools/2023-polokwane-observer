POLOKWANE – Mayor John Mpe said the Polokwane Municipality will take action against Falaz Security Services for failing to pay its personnel deployed during the Kaizer Chiefs and Royal AM match at the Peter Mokaba Sports Complex on Sunday (January 29). Personnel were reportedly promised R200 each after the game but were not paid, resulting in a large group of security guards sleeping outside the stadium waiting for payment. Community leader Vincent Kunutu told the Polokwane Review-Observer that some of the personnel arrived at the stadium at 05:00 on Sunday morning and worked through the day. “Some did not even have anything to eat. These people are parents and their children didn’t go to school today,” he said. Mpe intervened by addressing the angry group and agreed that the municipality would pay them before the end of the day. He explained that the municipality uses service providers for security and expressed his disappointment that workers had not been paid.  “We have taken over the responsibility of the service provider and arranged to pay the workers because we always put our people first. We will take action against the service provider in question. We are disappointed, however, the matter will be resolved before the end of the day,” he said. Falaz Security Services said unfortunate circumstances resulted in the payment delay of its personnel. “As a company, we would like to express our sincere apologies to all our employees and affiliates who were affected by this unfortunate event. We will do much better in the future as we continue to strive to render excellent services to our clients and improve the lives of our people,” a statement read.
