POLOKWANE – The Polokwane Municipality has reached an agreement with Kaizer Chiefs Football Club to host their Premier Soccer League matches at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Chiefs will play three of their home fixtures against Royal AM (January 29), Golden Arrows (February 18) and Swallows FC (May 2) in the City of Stars. According to the Polokwane Mayor John Mpe, the move is part of the municipality’s drive to promote sports tourism, grow the local economy and ensure maximum and effective utilization of sports facilities in the city. “This reunion calls for celebration for the people of Polokwane, particularly sport lovers, hawkers, public transport operators, hospitality industry and the malls as we expect more people to flock to the City of Stars during Kaizer Chiefs games,” he said during Friday’s press conference. He said Chiefs is a fan favourite after they lifted trophies while playing at Peter Mokaba Stadium between 2011 and 2015. “We are, therefore, hopeful that the club will revive that spirit and win more matches at Peter Mokaba Stadium.” Jessica Motaung, marketing and commercial director for Kaizer Chiefs said the club is excited to be back in Polokwane. “We are delighted to be back in Limpopo and the city of Polokwane in particular, where we receive great support. We are looking forward to three exciting games with a full stadium because we know that the people of Limpopo will come out in numbers because they love Amakhosi. Their support proved key in the past when we lifted the league trophy with Peter Mokaba Sports Complex as our home venue. We hope that history will be repeated when we play at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium again.” The announcement was made ahead of Kaizer Chief’s DStv Premiership game against Royal AM at the Peter Mokaba Sports Complex on Sunday (January 29) and the city is buzzing as the Glamour Boys return for their first home games in eight years.
