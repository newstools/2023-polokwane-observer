POLOKWANE – The 2022 matric class of Westenburg Secondary School and teachers gathered at the school on January 20 to celebrate the school’s 80% pass rate. According to Bettie Boom, principal the feat is a huge achievement compared to previous years. ”Last year we produced a 67% pass rate, so this is a huge achievement. We want to credit the teachers and the learners for their hard work. This is a collective effort. We had prayer sessions for matric learners everyday, the teachers baked muffins for them during the late night study sessions, we worked together with everyone toward these good results. We wish the learners well in their next academic chapter.” Top performing learner at the school Athel Makhura with one distinction in Afrikaans said she was happy with the progress made by the learners. “We worked well together with the teachers. We were a family, and assisted each other during the study sessions. I am happy to be part of this great school and I love to see the class of 2023 doing well.”
