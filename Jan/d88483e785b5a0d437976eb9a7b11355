POLOKWANE – A new year has started after a great festive season spent with loved ones. It is now time for the academic year to commence and what to pack for your bundle of joy to survive should be the least of your worries. The following are some of the basics to pack for your children: Crayons A box of triangular or jumbo crayons can be easier for small hands to hold, but many teachers may prefer a set of 8, 16, or 24 crayons in standard colours. Markers A 10-pack of standard markers provides plenty of colour options and washable ones allow for easier clean-up. Colored pencils Instead of or in addition to crayons, some teachers may request coloured pencils for fun rainbow writing, tracing, or colouring. Scissors Younger grades may require that students use a pair of blunt or rounded-tip scissors for safety. Most are designed for the right hand, so if your child is a lefty, pick up a designated left-handed pair. Smock A smock or oversize T-shirt will help keep your child’s clothes clean during messy arts and crafts. Glue Glue sticks are easier for a toddler to hold and control while liquid glue may be allowed for Gr 1s.
