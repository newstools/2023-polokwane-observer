POLOKWANE – Who’s to say that physical health and fitness requires strenuous exercise to achieve results? Yoga is a science of well being where you typically explore holding postures and breathing to help you feel more relaxed and more centered in mind, body and spirit. Yoga instructor, Sehlapelo Sidney Maleka explained that contrary to what some people think, yoga is not a religion, but an exercise. Maleka started yoga in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic because he wanted to explore various ways to continue being physically active. “Yoga became the answer as it was something that I always wanted to try out. I started out practicing alone at home and then started teaching and hosting retreats at various locations in Venda from October 2021,” he explained. He has hosted six retreats thus far.

Maleka dispels the misconception that you must be slim and flexible to start yoga as anyone can do it, young or old. “It is advisable for children to start at 7/8-years-old,” he said.
