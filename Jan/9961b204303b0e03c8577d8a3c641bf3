The rumours are no more, Suzuki listened and now you can have your unstoppable Jimny with five doors. The five-door Suzuki Jimny was revealed in India at the Auto Expo 2023, and of course, Jimny fans are exuberant. It is heading south, but the arrival time in South Arica is still to be confirmed. The Suzuki’s engineers have not tampered with the off-roader’s capabilities, power or overall structural rigidity. They kept the 1.5 petrol engine. You can kit your Jimny with either a four-speed manual or a five-speed automatic gearbox.  The 210mm ground clearance and advanced AllGrip four-wheel drive system, which allows for a change between 2WD and 4WD on the fly, are still very much a part of the Jimny as is the 4WD system for technical off-road driving. The five-door derivative is 360mm longer than its sibling, though. Its approach angle is 36 degrees, a break over angle of 24 degrees and a departure angle of 50 degrees. More information on the local launch date, the exact line-up, specifications and range will be made available at a later stage. Source: MotorPress
