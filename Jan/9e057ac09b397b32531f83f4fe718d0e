The Fronx is an SUV and was introduced at the Auto Expo 2023 in India. It is part of a new range crafted using Suzuki’s Crafted Futurism design language. The Fronx’s front end is quite imposing and with its large wheels, the design and the impression that it presents, promises a lot. The interior is large and spacious and offers access to 40-plus connected vehicle functions via a touchscreen. It shares the same platform as the Swift and the Baleno, and according to Suzuki, will impress its owners with its performance and road behaviour. The Fronx is one of three new Suzuki SUVs expected in South Africa. While the range, engines and pricing will only be made available later, the Fronx will slot in below the new Suzuki Grand Vitara.
