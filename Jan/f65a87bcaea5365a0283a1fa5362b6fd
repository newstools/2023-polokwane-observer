POLOKWANE – At the age of seven, Mogau Molepo says he knew pantsula dance is what he loved and what he intended to do with his life. Molepo, now 16 years old, is a pantsula dancer popularly know by his stage name ‘Mog Skutch’, who occasionally performs in the rural areas in and around Polokwane such as
Mahlodi, Ga-thoka, Paledi Mall and at Library Gardens. He says he found passion in dancing pantsula which is a traditional and high energy form of dance that originates from black townships when he was just seven
years old in 2013. “I was always looking at dance videos and my favourite of them all was pantsula dancers called Tembisa Red Devils and they inspired me to become a dancer,” said
Molepo. Pantsula dance is said to carry South African history and has transformed over time in an interesting quick-stepping technique which is also said to be inspired by other popular dances such as tap dancing and gumboot dance. Last year he won a contemporary dance competition in a Turfloop Jika Majika and in September he won the Sammabby Talent Show hosted at Paledi Mall. He says he is motivated to pursue a career in dance and wants to inspire other talented pantsula dancers to follow in his footsteps. “I would also like to have my own clothing brand, venture in photography and singing but for now I want to put dance first because I believe I was born to dance the others are extra interests that will act as back and help me balance my talent.” He adds that the dance better expresses his personality and is the most fun thing for him to do.
