The latest SVI Engineering masterpiece on wheels with armoured protection is the Nissan Patrol. It is luxury on wheels and now, with the B6 discreet armoured package, it offers 360-degree B6 protection against assault rifles, including the AK47, R5 and R1. The example seen here furthermore boasts optional B6 floor armour, while a bespoke SVI-designed bull bar is also available.  “Like the popular Land Cruiser 300, the Patrol has a storied history and serves as the brand’s longest-running nameplate today. With a legacy stretching back more than seven decades and a robust ladder-frame construction, the latest Patrol was the obvious next recipient of our comprehensive B6 bullet-resistant package,” said SVI business development director, Nicol Louw. The package makes extensive use of custom-fabricated armoured steel plates, composite materials and high-grade 38mm ballistic glass.  To save on both cost and overall mass, the 360-degree B6 armouring package for the Patrol incorporates a rear bulkhead neatly integrated behind the second row. A suspension upgrade is also included as standard, allowing the Japanese SUV to easily manage the additional mass of the comprehensive array of armouring materials, as are upgraded door hinges and protection for critical under-bonnet components. With 298Kw and 560Nm of power on tap, the extra weight poses no challenge for the Patrols’ V8 engine and seven-speed autobox. Cost Pricing starts at R981 823 (excluding VAT). The list of extra options available includes B6 roof armour, B6 floor armour, a PA system and heavy-duty runflat rings for the tyres. The build time is set at around four months. SVI also offers a B4 package – providing protection against handguns up to .44 Magnum, priced from R722 158 (excluding VAT). Source: QuickPic
