LIMPOPO – A large amount of cash in rands and other foreign currencies were among several items recovered during the arrest of six suspects for a farm attack in the Vhembe district. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the arrest was made during an intelligence-driven operation on Wednesday night (January 11) by members of the Trio Task Team following a farm attack at a game farm along the Tshipise road outside Musina in December 2022. “On December 27, 2022, five suspects entered the farm house and robbed the occupant of a Toyota Land Cruiser, 11 firearms, a laptop, cash in rands, US dollars, pounds and other currencies, as well as other valuables. The provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe then ordered that the suspects be hunted down and brought to book,” his statement read. Mojapelo said information led the team to four different locations: Makushu, Musekwa and Tshituni villages and the Greater Kuduland farm in the Vhembe District where the suspects were arrested. Eight firearms (five rifles and three pistols), 188 rounds of live ammunition, a black night vision camera, black Nikon binoculars, silver plate coins, jewellery, a bag of various foreign currencies and a box with old South African coins were recovered.
