If you’ve run out of store-bought bubble mixture or need a quick activity for the kids, making your own bubbles from washing-up liquid and water is simple. But what is the ideal ratio, and what can you use in the absence of a bubble wand? We experimented with various bubble mixtures and developed the best recipe for you to try at home with your children. • 50ml dishwashing liquid
• 300ml water 1. Pour the dishwashing liquid into a container, such as a jam jar or glass bottle.
2. Slowly pour in the water, taking care not to create too many bubbles. To combine, gently stir the mixture together using a chopstick.
3. Let the bubble mixture rest for a while (preferably overnight) before using it; this will improve the quality of your bubbles.
4. Once ready, dip a bubble wand (see instructions below on how to make one from scratch) into the mixture and let your child enjoy blowing bubbles outside! Don’t worry if you don’t have a wand from a store-bought bubble pot! You can have fun by looking around the house for different items that can be used to make bubbles. Here are a few suggestions to get you started: • Paperclips can be bent into wands or used as is
• Straws
• Pipe cleaners
• Biscuit cutters
• Fly swatters
