The Kawasaki Factory team has once again chosen a tough and experienced team to compete, and hopefully conquer the 2023 Cross-country Championship. The 2022 South African National High School champion, Wian Wentzel, is stepping up to the 250cc OR3 class. He will be riding a Pepson Plastics Factory KX 250 X. Then the old stalwart SA champion, Seniors man Kenny Gilbert, will again compete on a Pepson Plastics Factory KX 450 X alongside circuit car race star, Lee Thompson, on a KX 250 X. Ian Pepper will be joining them in the Masters’ class. Jaycee Nienaber will be there to bug the other competitors in the OR1 class on a Pepson Plastics Factory Kawasaki KX 450 X with Wade Den as his teammate. Kawasaki OR3 graduate, Taki Bogiages, who ended fourth in that championship in ‘22 and is looking forward to stepping up to the big class. Jake Pretorius joins Nathan Sinclair in 85cc Juniors. Human brothers, Clayton and Dylan, will race 85cc Juniors, where the team will also support Jayden Boyce in the GXCC races. “Although we aim to win and we will not pull any punches, winning is not everything for us. We also thrive on our strong family orientation and having fun,” says team principal, Iain Pepper. Source: MotorsportMedia / Photos: Action in Motion
