POLOWKANE – Cable theft has lead to a power outage in Serala View and the Industrial area in the city. The Polokwane Municipality said a maintenance team is working on restoring power supply. Spokesperson Thipa Selala said Serala View is affected by two incidents of cable theft on the 11 kilovolt (kV) line and vandalism of a meter box that supplies the area. “Power supply will be restored once the team has completed repairs, however, there is no estimated restoration time at the moment,” his statement read. Selala said affected users are advised to treat all electrical wiring as live and to switch off all appliances to avoid injury and damage once supply is restored.
