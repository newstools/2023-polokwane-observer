POLOKWANE – Lizzy Kgotlelelo Mokatse from Nirvana is a traffic officer with a heart of gold as she is constantly looking for an opportunity to help people who are less fortunate. She recently pledged to gather school shoes for 250 learners to start the 2023 school year on the right foot. She explained that although she doesn’t have a registered foundation, she started doing charity work in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. During that time, she started donating sanitary towels to girls from underprivileged backgrounds and she also adopted five families in Blood River that she assisted monthly. Mokatse said her passion for caring for others runs in the family. Her late grandmother, who was from Bochum, used to raise children who were less fortunate and she would also take in orphans. Her mother runs a soup kitchen during the festive season for people living on the streets. “Witnessing these acts of kindness, I hate seeing people suffer. It demoralises a person,” she said. The school shoe drive is close to her heart as it was suggested by her late grandmother. “She asked why I don’t donate school shoes to less fortunate learners and I told her that I don’t know how I would afford to buy all the shoes. She encouraged me to reach out to other people so that we can help as many children as possible,” she said. Mokatse has identified five schools as beneficiaries. The handover of shoes will take place at the end of January and she appeals to anyone with the means to donate to do so. Mokatse can be contacted on 060 790 1632 and shoe drop-offs can be made at 55 Bombay Avenue, Nirvana.
