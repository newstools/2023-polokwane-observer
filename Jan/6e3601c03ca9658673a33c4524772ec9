POLOKWANE – Emanuel Duma is a 25-year-old entrepreneur and founder of a male grooming and hair service shop called Legitimate Mobile Barber Shop. Due to being unemployed for a while, Duma said: “I used to cut people’s hair but it was a hobby that I enjoyed and was very good at. Eventually, I realised that I can make a living from it.” His business focuses on male grooming where they render professional haircut services, including cutting different trends which he says boosts people’s confidence. “I work with a lot of customers and it makes me happy to see people smile after I am done with their hair.” The reason for a mobile barber shop came as a result of the bad experiences he had with landlords, where he had to rent a business space with no guarantee of making a profit. As someone who had been unemployed for a while, he left his hometown for greener pasture in Polokwane, where he now runs one of the most-rated barber shops in town. He says as a young entrepreneur, people should let his work, commitment and skills speak for itself. “I enjoy the part where I get to meet a lot of different individuals and we would have chats while cutting their hair, discussing life experiences and motivating one another. However, it also means that I get to interact with those who have low expectations of my abilities.” Besides cutting peoples’ hair, Duma says he also sells male grooming products such as shaving creams, oils, beard oils and shampoo, among others. For a good haircut, Duma encourages that people make bookings via WhatsApp on 066 507 5042 or visit the mobile shop next to Thornhill Shopping Complex.
