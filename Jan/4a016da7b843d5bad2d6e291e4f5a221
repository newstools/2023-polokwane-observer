According to folklore, heartburn during pregnancy is a sure sign of a hairy baby. Truth be told, that is often the case. Lanugo is soft, downy body hair that approximately one-third of babies are born with. It is produced by foetal hair follicles between 16 and 20 weeks of pregnancy and keeps the baby warm inside the womb. Lanugo is shed into the amniotic fluid by most babies in utero (around 32 to 36 weeks). Other babies, particularly preemies, are born with lanugo, which usually falls out within a few weeks and is replaced by vellus hair, which is finer and more difficult to see. Lanugo hair can be very light to very dark in colour. Your baby’s genetics influence how light or dark their hair will be. Lanugo, for example, may be more visible in a baby with darker skin than in a baby with fair skin. Finding body hair on your newborn, whether it’s lanugo on their shoulders or a thick mop of hair on their head, can be startling. According to Beverly Kupfert, a paediatrician, hair is a common source of concern for new parents. Some are concerned about having too much hair, including lanugo, while others are worried that their baby will not have enough as they grow older. “Just because a baby is still bald at 18 months or later does not mean she will not have beautiful hair later,” Kupfert says. “What constitutes normal varies greatly.” In short, maybe. Just because a baby has curly hair in his first years does not mean it will remain curly in adulthood. Hair is constantly changing. Lanugo will disappear within a few days or weeks after your baby is born. That said, it’s normal for it to linger a little longer. Consult with their paediatrician if you have any concerns about your baby’s body hair.
