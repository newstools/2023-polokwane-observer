Offering a taste of refined history in each sip, the range of Courvoisier expressions has been expertly distilled, matured and blended in the Maison’s award-winning signature floral style, revealing intricate nuances influenced by the life and joy of the cognac region and its people. A rich palette of citrus, precise distillation and signature oak selection come together to offer an exquisitely balanced and vibrant range that includes VS, VSOP and XO. A cognac that transcends the category, Courvoisier lends itself to festive, daytime consumption with sessionable, slow-drinking cocktails such as The Gala and The French Twist. In the 1950s, Chief Blender André Boufflet developed a new cognac created to be mixed. This was a first and grew in popularity until the drink transformed into a lifestyle. Build all ingredients over ice and garnish with citrus. The French Twist is a perfect example of how our process enhances the cocktail: simple, approachable, elegant, and the perfect cocktail to be enjoyed, day or evening. Build all ingredients into a tin, except soda. Add one hand cracked 1×1 ice cube and shake until melted. Pour into a glass 1/2 full of cobble or crushed ice, add the soda water, then pack in extra ice and garnish with fruit. For more information on Courvoisier, please visit www.courvoisier.co.za.
