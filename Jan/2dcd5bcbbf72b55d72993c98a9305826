The jury is not out – not yet! The semi-finalists for the 2023 SA Car of the Year (COTY) have been announced. The 2023 SA COTY is sponsored by Old Mutual Insure. The semi-finalists: “Each semi-finalist has caught the attention of the judges precisely because they are not only relevant for today’s customers, but are also excellent contenders. We wish the jury the very best in the next round of voting, which we have no doubt will be tough given the calibre of this year’s semi-finalists,” said Garth Napier, MD of Old Mutual Insure.  The first step in the vehicle selection process was determining eligibility based on the COTY rules and regulations. The COTY validation committee reviewed more than 80 vehicles and determined that 55 of them met the stringent entry requirements. This January the recently announced COTY jury members will cast their votes to whittle the list of semi-finalists down to a list of finalists. These worthy contenders will then undergo a stringent evaluation process before the jury locks in their scores to crown the official 2023 South African Car of the Year. Source: SAGMJ
