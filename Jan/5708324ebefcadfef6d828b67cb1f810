POLOKWANE – When entering any beauty pageant, a woman must look past the fear of not making it into the spotlight. One must have great courage, combined with beauty and intelligence. This according to newly crowned Mrs Limpopo, Marisa Nel. She says serving the community, being able to give back and generally uplift everyone to help where she can, and to see where the need arises, make a sustainable difference in the community, not just in Polokwane. “This title is for the whole of Limpopo, which means I would like to assist wherever I can. I am proud to wear this sash, and I understand that it’s not about the crown and the sash, it’s about the platform, and it is about the people. I am here and ready to make a difference. As Mrs Limpopo, my division is for women who are married or divorced. I have been divorced for 14 years now,” said Nel. She said her mother used to tell her that if you don’t have time, make time. “Early up and early to rise makes one healthy, wealthy and wise. It wasn’t my goal at the beginning to enter, I then decided that 20 years ago I was a model and did it for fun, but now my mindset is right. I think I am doing it for the right reasons because I understand now that it’s not the crown and the sash, it is about so much more. I am here and ready to make a difference,” she said. “I want to leave a trail of positivity behind and show others that the impossible can become possible with the right mindset and hard work. Being crowned Mrs Limpopo 2023 doesn’t mean I automatically go through to Mrs South Africa. The rules have changed, and thus Mrs South Africa is an entirely different competition. “You can expect to see me active in the community with charity projects for people and animals, with social events where women and children will be empowered to become the best version of themselves. I want to be the voice for those who cannot speak for themselves,” she added.
