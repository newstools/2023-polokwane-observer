The simplicity of a great, golden-baked potato is just a thing of beauty. Top it with pan-fried mushrooms and some of your favourite classic potato-topper ingredients for a killer dinner. Mushrooms are an excellent low-calorie food, virtually fat-freed brilliant for weight management (six medium-sized white button mushrooms contain only 22 calories!). Mushrooms also support your gastrointestinal health, thanks to their supply of dietary fiber and fungal enzymes. Recipe by SA Mushroom Farmers’ Association.
