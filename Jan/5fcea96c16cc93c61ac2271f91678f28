POLOKWANE – Cases of negligence have been opened by four of the five victims who were mauled by a pitbull that roamed the streets of Seshego last Thursday. During the early afternoon, two pitbulls (one puppy) escaped from their yard resulting in the attack on local residents. One of the victims was bedridden after sustaining an injury to the calf. “I was the first person to be attacked while coming from work in Zone 3. The pitbull grabbed hold of my lower thigh, and I immediately froze. Luckily, it let go before clinging its teeth and they both fled,” another victim told BONUS. The dogs then attacked a woman in Zone 4 and later two men in Zones 6 and 8. They were admitted to the local hospital after sustaining major injuries from the attack. The victims are also receiving therapy. “I have two children that I must look after. The owner of these dogs must do his part and assist in the injury expenses,” one victim added. The owner of the animals has not yet been identified. Seshego community representative, Vincent Kunutu who recently returned from retiring as the community leader, says he has received several appeals from local residents that Seshego Community Against Crime and Gangsterism spreads awareness in the community about dogs that roam freely. The SPCA arrived swiftly and rescued the dogs which they have since placed under close care. The investigating officer responsible says it has been difficult to identify some of the finer details around who the owner of the dogs is, but investigations are ongoing.
