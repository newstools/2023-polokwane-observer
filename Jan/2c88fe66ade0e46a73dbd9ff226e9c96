It is often said that once you have owned a Subaru, you never want to be without one. And there is a reason for that. The Outback is all the family car you are ever likely to need – and, in the real world, it is all the off-roader you are ever likely to need too. This is according to Alan Kidd, editor of 4×4 Magazine. Kitted with modern technology, a spacious cabin with flexible cargo space, a superb suspension set-up and safety features, this may well be the ideal family estate.  Pat Ryan, Subaru UK’s managing director, said, “We are delighted that the Outback has won the 4×4 Magazine’s Best Crossover Estate of the Year sponsored by BFGoodrich. “This is a fantastic car that our customers love and trust year after year, mile after mile. Subaru customers know what it means to be driving one of the safest, most capable and reliable vehicles on the road today.” Source: Newspress
