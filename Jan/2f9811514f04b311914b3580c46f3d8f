Car Design News’ annual Car Design Review book awarded the Range Rover its Production Car of the Year Award. It was praised for its reductive design and the way it combines a modern luxury aesthetic with an iconic form that links the new vehicle to its unrivalled 50-year lineage. The panel of jurors included design leaders from Polestar, Lamborghini, Volvo and Lucid. Prof Gerry McGovern OBE, chief creative officer, Jaguar Land Rover, said, “Range Rover is the original luxury SUV and a vehicle of peerless distinction. The new Range Rover’s exceptional form embodies modern luxury, and its elegant proportions and optimised volumes are hallmarks of our reductive design philosophy. This approach was introduced with the Velar in 2017 and is now familiar across our Range Rover family.” The new Range Rover is clean and elegant. It offers a drag coefficient of only 0.3 – the lowest of any luxury SUV. Maximilian Missoni, head of design, Polestar, said, “For someone who knows what a challenge maintaining purity throughout the process can be, this car and its creators have my full respect.” The multiple-award-winning Range Rover is priced from R2 966 600 in South Africa.
