With the rising cost of art supplies, finding extra money to buy your child finger paints and play dough can be challenging. The good news is that making your own eco-friendly, non-toxic art supplies at home is easier than you think. Money saved aside, you’ll also know precisely what is going into them, and most of these recipes can be whipped up in less time than it would take to go to the store. This play dough is not only edible (though it is not tasty, so sampling is strongly discouraged), but it can also be made in about 10 minutes and lasts much longer than store-bought play dough. It is simple to store in plastic containers, resealable bags, or recycled plastic containers from store-bought dough (after it has dried out). If the homemade dough becomes dry or is left out for too long, work a little water into it, and it will be as good as new. Through sensory play, finger painting is an excellent way for children to explore, learn, and develop. It encourages children’s creativity when they can feel the cool, squishy texture of the paint and experiment with colour and patterns. It’s also a good way for kids to express themselves. This watercolour paint is inexpensive and available in virtually any colour or scent your child prefers. Purchase unsweetened drink mixes because sugary varieties will result in very sticky fingers and kitchen surfaces. This edible fingerpaint variation is especially enjoyable for children under the age of one who are still exploring food, textures, and feeding themselves. There is no need for paper; allow them to “paint” their high chair tray. Give your toddlers this paint and brushes, and send them to the bathtub for a fun twist. They can have fun painting in the bath, but they will need an extra rinse when they are finished!
