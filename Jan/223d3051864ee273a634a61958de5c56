POLOKWANE – With nine distinctions, Tapiwa Mukonoweshuro is ready for his actuarial science journey at the University of the Witwatersrand. The 18-year-old matriculated at Northern Academy and is the top achiever for independent schools in the province. The school was also announced as the best performing independent school after reaching a milestone of 200 bachelor passes from 439 learners who wrote the National Senior Certificate examination. Mukonoweshuro says he has his mom’s advice to thank for his results, on the correct curation and execution of a vision board as it reminds one of his short and long-term goals. “Matric was a great milestone in my short term goals and I wanted just a distinction in English. The vision board becomes the centre of my decision making from the time I decide to wake up or sleep late, I was taught by my mom, my biggest supporter,” he says. His daily routine had changed holistically to suit his focus on passing with exemptions, including the ‘little breaks’ from absorbing information, which Tapiwa says are vital for the body and mind. He did away with social media, the internet and television for a walk or drive around the neighbourhood from time to time. The teachers and school head Fred Romijn are given endless appreciation by the rising scientist for availing sufficient attention and resources for him to practise with during the course of the academic year. “We were not always on the same page but I opened myself up to being corrected and practising until I got it correct, they made my stay in the class worthwhile,” he adds.
