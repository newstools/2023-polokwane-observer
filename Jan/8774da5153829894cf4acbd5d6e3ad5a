Start the year right and plan your getaways to ensure you don’t burn out and maintain a good work-travel balance. For the ultimate haven of peace and tranquility, make sure to add Agulhas Country Lodge to your list of must-visit weekend escapes. Set in L’Agulhas in the Western Cape at the southernmost tip of Africa, this Cape Country Routes hallmark property is built from natural limestone, allowing it to blend beautifully into the background of the rocky hill. Its elevated position makes for remarkable sea views from nearly every vantage point.  The four-star graded lodge has eight en-suite rooms – all with showers (some have baths and showers), and two honeymoon rooms with Jacuzzi baths and double showers. All rooms have sea-view balconies so that you can really soak up the surrounding beauty. The cozy, welcoming bar with a fireplace has a gorgeous, enclosed balcony with stunning views of the sea and is perfect for whale watching, while sipping on a glass of Merlot. Take advantage of the various relaxation areas, including a cigar lounge, a quaint pub with an air force/maritime theme, a TV room and a lounge area. Pack your bikini and enjoy swimming at the longest uninterrupted white beach in Southern Africa at Struisbaai. There are also two tidal pools within walking distance of the hotel and the second oldest working lighthouse in South Africa is a brisk walk away.
