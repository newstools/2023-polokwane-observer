For the first time in its rich history Bentley has sold more than 15 000 cars per year. This is 4% up on its 2021 sales.
This is as a result of it offering Mulliner personalisation and Bentley’s new hybridised models. The demand for SUVs ensured Bentayga remained Bentley’s number-one model. The Continental GT and GT Convertible accounted for nearly a third of sales with 31% of them claimed by the GT Speed. The Flying Spur boasts 28% of the total sales. The Americas maintained its position as the biggest selling global market, selling more than ever before.
Last year also recorded a significant increase for the oldest coachbuilder in the world, Bentley Mulliner, with the number of personal commissions increasing fivefold in the past five years.  Adrian Hallmark, the chairperson and CEO of Bentley Motors, says, “In what was another year of unpredictability, the business overcame significant headwinds and displayed great resilience to deliver the third consecutive record sales year. This underlines our brand strength, operational excellence and strong global demand by market and model. “The reaction to the market introduction of our hybrid models, Flying Spur joining Bentayga last year, demonstrates the path in which the luxury sector is heading, and we are positioned firmly at the forefront. These numbers are validation that we not only lead the sector in sales and market share, but also investment in electric technologies and commitment to being net carbon neutral in 2030.” Source: Bentley
