Volvo Trucks South Africa has 19 dealers across the country to support its customers with superb after sales service. And now, Eswatini has been added to the network. “With the Volvo Trucks vehicle parc continuing to increase, we are strengthening our reach with a focused strategy of bringing valuable support right to our customers’ doorsteps,” says Waldemar Christensen, MD of Volvo Trucks South Africa. eSwatini has close economic ties to South Africa, which it depends on for about 85% of its imports and 60% of its exports. The country is also a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA), with Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa. For this reason, many South African logistics companies run cargo to and from eSwatini, with additional support required to ensure the productivity of their fleets. The Motruck operations are strategically located in the Matsapha industrial area, with easy access to numerous major roads, including the MR3 highway. Several of Volvo Trucks’ major fleet customers also have their depots and headquarters in the area. Source: Tanje Wandrag
