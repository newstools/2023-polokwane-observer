POLOKWANE – The Ugandan national who was on December 30 found by police in his Mahlasedi Park rental home in Polokwane with over R100 000 of what is believed to be counterfeit money, had according to sources recruited an employee of the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture to conduct his fraudulent activities. The man now faces multiple charges of fraud, illegal immigration and possession of counterfeit money. When the 37-year-old male approached the female victim on first attempt, according to Limpopo police, he pretended to need help with buying an undisclosed chemical substance often used to remove dye-stain on defaced cash amounting to R2.5m, and requested R200 000 from her to make the purchase, which he promised to return in double. “All of this was demonstrated to her with authentic money and was assured to be paid R400 000 in return. Afterwards, the victim made a withdrawal of R200 000 and gave it to the suspect with the hope to acquire more money,” Limpopo police spokesperson Col Malesela Ledwaba confirmed. The woman was then reimbursed with counterfeit cash. An intelligence-driven operation was then planned after the man requested more money from the woman. ”Our operation was executed and the suspect was subsequently arrested at his rental residence in Mahlasedi Park after receiving the money from the victim. Upon his arrest, we found him in possession of counterfeit money with chemicals and the remaining R161 000 which belonged to the victim,” Ledwaba added. Police have not disclosed whether the lured official will also face charges, as an accessory for investing money into an evidently criminal activity of cleaning defaced cash.
