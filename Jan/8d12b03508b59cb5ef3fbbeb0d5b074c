Convenience food is, well, convenient, especially when you have little time to prep healthy meals. But this is not the answer to a healthy lifestyle. Instead, try to adopt the following three habits: Pack protein, high-fibre snacks. They are not only convenient, but supply nutrients to keep you energised. You will feel fuller for longer, curb the desire to snack and build lean muscle. Plan your meals for the week, during the weekend. Shop and prepare the food, and store it in marked containers. Dinner time will be less stressful. But planning doesnâ€™t only apply to the foods you eat. Be prepared and pack a bag with all your gym essentials and leave it in your car. This visual reminder will encourage you to work out more often.  Eating according to a meal plan can feel impossible, especially on celebration days. Friends will understand if you speak to them about your health goals. They might even surprise you by serving a tasty health platter inspired by your needs! Make sure you eat a protein-rich snack beforehand to resist menu temptations. Mind the salad dressing, as it can be more calorific than a slice of cake! Stick to water, great conversation, and chilled vibes.
