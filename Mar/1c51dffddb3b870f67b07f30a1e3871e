POLOKWANE – The owners of a wholesale store in the city say other bulk sales stores should be on the lookout for a group of people trying to scam them by means of fraudulent till slips. The modus operandi is simple: A customer makes a legitimate sale, only to hand over the slip to their “errand runners” a week or two later, with the slip showing inflated figures compared to the original one. The administration manager of this particular store, says in their case the security officer noticed an errand runner who said he had come to collect goods that had been purchased. “The customer bought goods to the value of R437.40, but the fake slip showed the same goods at an inflated figure, with the total rounding up to that of R24 500.” You might also want to read: Polokwane businessman arrested for R1.9m tender scam The owner said they managed, through company processes, to track the original transaction, and realised that the receipt had been altered. “So when the errand runner came, he insisted on collecting the bulk of the goods.” According to the manager, the security officer was able to identify the fake slip because the fraudster used a different entrance, and he questioned why the sale was not handled by a sales manager. “Upon questioning the errand runner, he said he did not know the person who sent him personally, and would not be able to assist us.” They confirmed that a criminal case had been opened with the police. The wholesaler’s management has warned other business owners of being vigilant. The police’s media liaison officer, Col Malesela Ledwaba said investigations into the matter continue.
