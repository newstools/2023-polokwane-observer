Science is everywhere around us, and it’s never too early to start exploring it. As parents, we can help our preschoolers develop a love of science by engaging them in fun, hands-on activities that teach them about the world around them. In this article, we will explore five fun and educational science activities that you can do with your preschooler. These activities are easy to do at home with simple materials, and they will surely be a hit with your little ones. The Magic Milk Experiment is a classic science activity that is sure to fascinate your preschooler. This activity involves using milk, food colouring, and dish soap to create a swirling, colourful display. To do this experiment, pour a thin layer of milk into a shallow dish. Add a few drops of different-coloured food colouring to the milk. Then, add a drop of dish soap to the centre of the dish, and watch the colours swirl and mix together. You can also use a toothpick to create patterns in the milk. Benefits: This activity teaches preschoolers about surface tension, chemical reactions, and colour mixing. The Balloon Rocket Experiment is a fun and easy activity that teaches preschoolers about air pressure and motion. To do this experiment, you will need a long piece of string, a straw, a balloon, and some tape. Tie the string between two chairs or other stable objects. Thread the straw onto the string and tape it in place. Blow up the balloon and attach it to the straw with a piece of tape. Then, let go of the balloon and watch it fly along the string like a rocket. Benefits: This activity teaches preschoolers about the properties of air and motion, as well as cause and effect. The Sink or Float Experiment is a classic activity that teaches preschoolers about buoyancy and density. To do this experiment, you will need a large bowl of water and various objects of different sizes and weights. Have your preschooler predict whether objects will sink or float in the water. Then, test each object by placing it in the water and observing what happens. Benefits: This activity teaches preschoolers about the properties of different materials and the concepts of buoyancy and density. The Rainbow in a Jar Experiment is a colourful activity that teaches preschoolers about the concept of density. To do this experiment, you will need a tall glass or jar, honey, dish soap, water, vegetable oil, rubbing alcohol, and food colouring. Pour each liquid into the jar in a specific order – honey, dish soap, water, vegetable oil, and rubbing alcohol. Add a few drops of different-coloured food colouring to the jar, and watch as the colours separate into layers. Benefits: This activity teaches preschoolers about the properties of liquids and the concept of density. Homemade slime is a fun and easy activity that teaches preschoolers about chemical reactions and the properties of matter. To make homemade slime, you will need glue, borax, and water. Mix equal parts of glue and water in a bowl. Mix one teaspoon of borax in a separate bowl with one cup of warm water. Add the borax solution to the glue mixture, and stir until the slime forms. Benefits: This activity teaches preschoolers about chemical reactions and the properties of matter, and it’s a great way to engage their senses and creativity.
