Creamy amasi baby marrow soup combines the freshness of baby marrows with the tangy and creamy taste of amasi, a traditional South African fermented milk. The creamy texture of the soup is achieved by blending the cooked vegetables and amasi into a smooth and velvety consistency. Recipe compliments of Rediscover Dairy.
