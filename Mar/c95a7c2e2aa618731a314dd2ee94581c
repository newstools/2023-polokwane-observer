Investigating officer Serg Letlotlo Lucas Ledwaba confirmed that the police have strong evidence against Phofedi, including CCTV footage and an admission statement he made to a senior police official concerning his role in the gruesome murder. Phofedi, in a statement heard by the court through his defence lawyer, stated that he is taking care of his four children and his mother who has a chronic illness and depends on him to provide for her medical needs and therefore has to be released on bail. Ledwaba indicated that the suspect has the potential to engage in more criminal activities should he be released on bail, following his past convictions. Motshoane abandoned his bail application. The matter was postponed to the March 6 for further bail hearing and the suspects will remain in custody.
