POLOKWANE – Power supply has been restored to several suburbs and businesses in the city following a planned outage. Areas affected included Bendor, Serala View, Eduan Park and Fauna Park among others, while both Mall of the North and Savannah Mall and other businesses were also affected. The spokesperson for the Polokwane Municipality Thipa Selala confirmed that the maintenance team completed repairs on a broken earth wire on the Alpha 66 kilovolts (kV) line and installed new high voltage equipment at the Gamma Substation. The outage was meant to last for eight hours from 08:00 to 16:00 but Selala said it was restored at 13:00 due to the completed work. Residents who were not affected by the outage did not experience load-shedding but Selala said it would return for the entire city according to schedule. “Eskom’s scheduled load-shedding will be implemented from 13:00,” he said.
