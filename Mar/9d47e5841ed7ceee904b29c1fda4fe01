Suzuki sold 4 309 compacts in February. This is up 33% on February 2022. In January 2023 it sold 35% more cars than in January 2022 and finished the year with a 13.85% market share. Naamsa recorded a 2.5% growth rate for the industry with 29 976 passenger cars making up the total sales of 45 352 units. In February, the Suzuki Swift found 1 367 new homes, followed by the Suzuki Baleno (655 units) and Suzuki Jimny (129 units). The new generation Suzuki Celerio sold 127 units. This constitutes 3 401 units sold via the dealer network.  “For Suzuki, our dealer sales have always been the barometer of our success. Unlike fleet and government sales which are often made in bulk, dealer sales represent a decision by an individual or family to spend their hard-earned money on a Suzuki. It is a real vote of confidence in the brand and our customer service. “To be the second best-selling dealer channel with 90 dealers in a market in which some brands have over 100 or even 200 dealers means that customers have gone out of their way to buy a Suzuki. Suzuki dealers have reciprocated by sourcing the right model, assisting with finance and insurance, and giving a level of customer service that is rewarded by return visits and good referrals,” says Henno Havenga, manager of dealer sales at Suzuki Auto. The 92nd Suzuki dealer, Suzuki Mossel Bay, was opened in February. Source: MotorPress
