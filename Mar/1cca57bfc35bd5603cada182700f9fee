POLOKWANE – Northern Muslim School principal Takura Langton Warinda says the revamps at the school are key to the school’s objective of becoming a two-stream school. According to Warinda they can’t afford to have a one-stream school due to the high number of learners. “Currently we have 420 learners at the school and we want to grow the figure to 650. We need a two-stream school so that we have more than one class per grade. Currently we have one class for each grade but we would like to become bigger.” He said they are done with the garden and playing areas for foundation phase and senior phase.  “We completed the areas last year. It is a beautiful area where learners can enjoy themselves during break time. We wanted to create a safe playing environment for them so that they can enjoy coming to school. We have revamped the school’s parking area to ease traffic flow. It was difficult to deal with traffic during peak hours. The new parking area will help us to deal with the traffic.” He said they will add more aesthetics for beautification so that the school can look appealing.  “We have also put solar lights and LED lights in the classrooms and the halls. During the next phase we will focus on the sport facility and library. We need a state of the art library,” he said.
