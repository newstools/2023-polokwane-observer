With a sense of adventure and some planning you can get out the house or break up the long stretches of a road trip. Remember the roads are notoriously busy over the long Easter weekend, so it is always advisable to plan your route and keep your loved ones up to date to ensure a safe outing every time. “South Africa is filled with unique and cost-effective ‘leg stretching’ locations,” says Charlette Roetz, Tracker’s head of marketing, “so when you are planning a road trip, factor in safe rest stops that are also fun for the family or friends you may be travelling with.
