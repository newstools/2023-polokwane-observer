Read more: Deacon murder accused to find new legal representation Under presiding Judge Marisa Naudé-Odendaal, it was announced at the start of proceedings on January 19 that the state’s legal aid did not have records of Mmako requesting new legal representation. Proceedings were earlier postponed after the accused’s legal representatives withdrew from the case. Mmako, who is out on bail, needs to have found legal counsel by the set date in order for proceedings to resume, while Mudau remains in custody. The two are accused of murdering the Deacon women in 2020. The Deacons were attacked in their townhouse on September 10, and their bodies were found in the back of Lizette’s vehicle after police gave chase and the driver of the vehicle abandoned it next to the R37. Mmako, who was employed by Lizette Deacon, is believed to be the mastermind behind the murders. She was arrested days after the crimes, along with her co-accused.
