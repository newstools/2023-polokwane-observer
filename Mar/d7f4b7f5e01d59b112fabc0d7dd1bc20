A child needs to know the basic skills of using a computer. It also helps if a child knows how to use the toolbar in the office programmes. This all forms part of our literacy programme.” She added that in the next phase they will be focusing on block-base coding and then move on to languages such as Java script and html. “Coding and robotics have many advantages such as logical thinking, reasoning, problem solving and are also very good for mathematical reasoning, among others.”
