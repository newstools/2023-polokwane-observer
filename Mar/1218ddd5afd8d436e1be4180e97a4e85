LIMPOPO – Farmers in Vhembe are counting their losses, following two weeks of heavy downpours that caused massive damage to their crops, livestock and road infrastructure. All around, rivers are in flood and dams overflow, while roads and bridges have been swept away. Some areas, however, have especially been severely affected. Farmers from the Nwanedi area told CV that they were yet to recover from the impact. Margaret Mukwevho, a crop farmer in the area, said the downpours had affected farming operations badly, with most crops showing signs of nitrogen deficiency because of water logging. She has lost thousands of rands. “We have already planted our crops, and now the fields are full of water. The storage sheds are full of water too and the fertiliser that was kept there is no more. Everything on the farm is full of water. I appealing to government to come and assist us,” Mukwevho said. Another crop farmer, Maano Ramatshimbila, said damages to his farm were estimated at more than R500 000. “We had severe rains over the past few weeks. We are holding our collective breath that the heavy rains cease to fall in order for us to harvest our tomatoes,” he said. Livestock farmer Emmanuel Mudau said although they were grateful for the recent rain, which has brought much-needed relief, it also brought concerns. “Continuous rain causes standing water, which is the ideal breeding place for mosquitoes, which then transmit the Rift Valley fever virus that causes pregnant livestock to abort their young”. He advised livestock farmers to monitor and control animal diseases before and during the rainy season by providing feed supplements such as licks – especially for pregnant animals. He also advised farmers to vaccinate their livestock.
