POLOKWANE – The South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (Sanral) has announced an increase in toll tariffs effective from March 1. The increase was gazetted by government on February 10 as tariffs are adjusted annually in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as obtained from Statistics South Africa. Sanral said toll monies are used to maintain, operate and improve toll roads to ensure that the roads agency fulfills its mandate of delivering quality road infrastructure that adds value to South African citizens. The N1 between Polokwane and Pretoria as well as from Polokwane to Musina is one of the busiest routes in South Africa with thousands of motorists using the route on a daily basis. The six main toll gates on this route include Nyl, Kranskop, Carousel and Pumulani going south and the Baobab and Capricorn when travelling north. We break down the N1 tolls for you:  The Carousel toll plaza has seen the biggest increase with R5 from R62 in 2022 to R69 in 2023, while Kranskop will now cost motorists R53.50 with an increase of R3.50. A round trip from Polokwane to Pretoria that would usually cost R382 will now cost R408 while a round trip from Polokwane to Musina will now cost R218.  Sanral added that toll fees allow for a continuous revenue stream provided by those that make use of a tolled road. “Toll fees mean there will always be funds to optimally maintain roads, which makes roads safer and saves money in the long run,” a statement read.
