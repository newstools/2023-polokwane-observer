Fuso debuted in South Africa in the 1980s and its durability has since endeared it to small and medium business owners. The T720 cab-over 1963 Canter has proved itself a workhorse of note and is recognised for its driving performance and economy.  Currently sold in more than 70 countries around the world, 2023 marks its 60th anniversary. Throughout its six-decade history, the Canter has delivered every aspect required of a light-duty truck at the highest level. On top of consistent performance and driver comfort, it has achieved ever greater levels of fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness over the years with continuous engine improvements and hybrid technology.  “Since its first market entrant in the early 1980s, the Canter has played an integral part in our Fuso Trucks brand success story in South Africa and has deservingly earned its status among customers and drivers alike as the ‘light gallop’ in the light-duty segment. The next 60 years of Canter are exciting and worth looking forward to, as we cast our eyes towards adapting to the rapid shift in the commercial vehicles industry of electrification and connectivity,” says Michael Dietz, the president and CEO of Daimler Truck Southern Africa.
