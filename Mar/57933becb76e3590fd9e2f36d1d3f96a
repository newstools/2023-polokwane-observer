LIMPOPO – Ntshengedzeni Munyai from Madombidzha, locally known as “Muntshe”, ensures he never has to go to bed hungry. He is a shoemaker, working from his little workshop at Louis Trichardt’s taxi rank, where he specialises in restoring old shoes. For Muntshe, everything started 15 years ago when he taught himself how to repair shoes. “I did not want to engage myself in crime as I have seen many people destroy their future in this way by ending up in jail. I work hard to earn my money honestly, and this gives me peace of mind every day.” He is proud to say he does not overcharge his clients either. “Most of my clients come from faraway places such as Nzhelele, Elim and Sinthumule/Kutama. I have many regular clients who depend on me time and again. Every shoe that is brought to me has its own requirements. I carefully analyse it to figure out the best way to fix it while keeping the client’s budget in mind.” Working on his own, he says he keeps himself motivated and focused, which gives him the courage to work hard every day. He has big dreams for the future, the biggest one being to own a large shoe-repair franchise in the province through which he will be able to offer many local people work. He encourages young people to try and do something for themselves. “Times are tough and work is very scarce. Use your imagination to get yourself off the ground. Work hard and be proud of what you do. Never be ashamed of yourself, and stay away from drugs,” he advised.
