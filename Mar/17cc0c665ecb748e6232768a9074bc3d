Volvo has sold more than 4 300 trucks across 38 countries since 2019. South African commercial drivers and fleet owners will be able to buy Volvo’s electric trucks in the extra-heavy duty segment from March this year. “There are of course some infrastructural and legislative obstacles to overcome, but together with our customers and other stakeholders, we are working hard to ensure the success and longevity of heavy electric trucks in South Africa,” said Waldemar Christensen, MD of Volvo Trucks South Africa. In Europe, Volvo Trucks has a market share of 32%. In North America, its share is even higher. In 2022 the 16-tonne segment grew by 200%, said Volvo, and it has sold more trucks in this segment than any other manufacturer.  “We are determined to lead the electric truck transformation and our market-leading position in 2022, not only in Europe, but also in North America and other markets, is proof that we are doing just that. Although the market for electric trucks is still small, the trend is clear: many of our customers are now starting their shift to electric. We intend to be the catalyst for this transition and aim for 50% of our global sales of new trucks to be electric in 2030,” said Roger Alm, president of Volvo Trucks. Volvo’s product portfolio can accommodate a wide range of customer requirements. “It is our mission to support customers in making the switch to electric trucks,” said Alm. Source: QuickPic
