POLOKWANE – Areas not affected by the planned power outage on Friday (March 10) will not experience load-shedding, says the Polokwane Municipality. A large part of the city will be without electricity supply as a team repairs a repair broken earth wire on the Alpha 66 kiloVolts (kV) line and installs a new high voltage equipment at the Gamma Substation. “In order for the municipality to complete the work successfully, most areas within the city cluster will need to be switched off from 08:00 to 16:00. As a result, areas not affected by the interruption will not experience load-shedding for the duration of the maintenance work,” municipal spokesperson Thipa Selala said. The following areas will be affected: Selala said power supply will be restored once the municipal maintenance team has completed repairs. “Scheduled load-shedding will then be implemented as directed by Eskom after completion of maintenance work. All affected areas are advised to treat all electrical wiring as live and to switch off all appliances to avoid injury and damage when supply is restored,” his statement concluded.
