POLOKWANE – “Being a twin means spending your life arguing about who is the original and who is the remix.” This saying couldn’t be furthest from the truth for twin brothers and DJs Mahlatse and Mahlogonolo Shaku who form part of the duo ‘100%TwinsDJs’. The twins have created a brand taking advantage of being twins. Working together means that they spend most of their time together on a personal and professional level. Review spoke to the duo to find out how they manage their relationship both at home and at work. Mahlogonolo, the younger of the twins said that they love working together and they wouldn’t change it for anything. “It is very good working with my twin because we came on earth at the same time and God gave us the same gift. As a result, we are the most complete DJs in the world,” he said. Because they know each other so well, they are able to feed of each other’s energy and become an even better team. They don’t necessary share the same opinions but because they share the same passion and love for the industry, they are able to put aside any difference and deliver on what they are called to do.
