A charcuterie board is a favourite of hosts and guests alike. While “charcuterie” technically refers to a variety of cured meats, these platters frequently include cheeses, crackers, spreads, and fruit in addition to salami and prosciutto. But what exactly is it that makes them so popular? To begin with, they are exceedingly adaptable: You may change the ingredients to suit your tastes, scale the servings up or down dependent on the number of visitors, and make them as cheap (or as expensive) as you wish. You can also connect them to a certain theme, such as a colour, geographic region, or season. The fact that they require no culinary skills to assemble makes them ideal for entertaining. However, there is an art to creating a charcuterie board that looks as good as the ones you’ve seen on Instagram and Pinterest. Don’t worry, we’ve got an impressive charcuterie board complement of McCain for your next gathering or holiday party. Prep Time: 10 minutes | Total Time: 35 minutes
