LIMPOPO – Comedian and businessman Livhuwani Madadzhe caused a stir when he appeared in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court for the first time on January 30 on allegations of murdering his wife Lindelani Nengovhela, as he pleaded to be released to go and bury his late wife. The court postponed the case to allow him to seek legal representation. A day later, the legal representative was in court, but Madadzhe had since opted to abandon his bail application in what many believed was a fear of the crowd that was protesting outside court against the granting of bail.

Again, the legal representative was not in court and the case was postponed to March 30 for further investigations, but the representative, who had been busy with another matter in court on the same day, then approached the court indicating his client wanted to apply for bail, which was granted. A date of March 4 was agreed upon and set for the formal bail application. Limpopo NPA spokesperson Mashudu Dzhangi Malabi confirmed the arrangement. The 38-year-old comedian from Mangondi Sidou stands accused of murdering his wife and throwing her body in a water-filled pit in his yard. A day before her murder, Lindelani Nengovhela known as Mme a Muofhe had withdrawn the assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm charges she had laid against the comedian in November 2022. A celebratory party was held at their house shortly before she was murdered on January 28. The comedian was arrested and charged the same day.
