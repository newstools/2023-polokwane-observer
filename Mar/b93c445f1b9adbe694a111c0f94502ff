POLOKWANE – The PEPPS spirit committee pulled out all stops to make sure that such a fun-filled experience takes shape recently when families, teachers and learners spent a day together. The school spent two weeks from February 6, organising bouncing castles, water games and food for a proper family picnic to be held at the school. The three groups formed strong bonds that would ultimately benefit the development of the learners and the love of the school. “Our aim is merely just to have fun. Parents brought along their picnic baskets, umbrellas, camp chairs, crockery and non-alcoholic beverages, to enjoy a worry free day,” a member of the committee, Lauren Malope explained. Some Gr 7 learners assisted with arranging the day’s programme, which they said was an eye opener. “We took on the responsibility and sometimes it was hard, especially when things didn’t come together. We are so proud,” Unene Mtsetwane said. Dads ensured some good laughs during a soccer match and tug of war.
