Several test mules of Volkswagen’s supposed electrified Tiguan models were spotted in SA early last week. Here is what CAR Magazine thinks might be on the table for an electrified version of VW’s flagship midsize SUV offering – dubbed the ID.Tiguan – which is expected towards the end of the decade. Two units of what appear to be electrified variants of Volkswagen’s Tiguan model were spotted heading from what we can only assume was the Gerotek Test Facility adorned in all black and exposing some interesting frame updates. Additionally, other test models wearing the ‘Elektrofahrzeug’ (electric vehicle) stickers were seen in the area which also includes a Taigo. Many EV models are often formed to ensure the best aerodynamic design possible in an effort to improve range. What this results in is a figure that is often composed of shapely lines and contoured elements. These electrified Tiguans appear to be no exception. A familiar front end is the most notable visible change imposed on the electrified Tiguan which seems to be wearing aesthetics of a pre-facelift second-generation model. Gone are the winged-tipped headlights and domineering horizontal grille seemingly replaced by a simpler single horizontal coupled with simpler headlamps that stray away from the flared headlamp design. Other notable features include the gaping opening in the rear bumper curtailing two horizontal lights and aero-styled rims. Volkswagen South Africa has supplied no comment at this moment regarding these test mules but the South African highveld is no stranger to these projects, being a notable test bed for many manufacturers wanting to conduct high-altitude testing in warm environments.
