Reflecting on new vehicle sales performance for the month of February 2023, recent figures show that new vehicle sales continue to build on momentum from the opening month of the year. This is great news for the industry, as it continues to recover from the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the latest data released by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa, total domestic new vehicle sales increased by 1 128 units, or 2,6%, to 45 352 units, compared to the same period last year. The growth can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increase in consumer confidence and the improved economic outlook. However, year-on-year vehicle exports declined by 11,5%, from 34 352 units in February 2022 to 30 409 units in February 2023. Overall, of the 44 224 vehicles that were reported as having been sold across the industry, an estimated 37 091 units, or 83,6%, were dealer sales. Another estimated 9,0%, 5,1%, and 2,3%, respectively, were sales to the vehicle rental industry, government, and corporate fleet.
