The Cape 1000 was conceptualised and run for the first time in 2022. 2023’s event, ‘South Africa’s Most Beautiful Drive’, is scheduled for March 19 to 24 and received 60 entries thus far. These include a 1957 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Roadster, one of five 1935 Bentley Blue Trains, a 1973 Ferrari Daytona GTB4, a 1993 Lamborghini Diablo and a super-rare 2008 Bugatti Veyron. “We were overwhelmed and thrilled with the number and variety of cars registered for the event,” said the event’s director, Vanessa Crichton, “and adding to that, a number of city councils in the Western Cape have welcomed us with open arms and we look forward to creating public experiences with them.”  This year, the organisers included a fifth category, ‘Specials’, to accommodate cars like the 1965 Shelby Daytona Coupe Continuation, a 1933 Ford Model B Pickup RestoMod and a 1956 Porsche 365 Speedster Recreation. This new category joins the Tribute, Classic, Modern Classic and Sports ones. Inspired by legendary tribute races from all over the world, the Cape 1000 will present participants with a 60% touring and 40% regularity combination that will offer both fun and more competitive driving. The rally starts and ends at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town, meanders through to Hermanus, then to George and Franschhoek, before heading back to the Waterfront. Entrants can expect stunning scenery, accommodation in some of South Africa’s finest hotels, and true petrolhead camaraderie.  The route’s convenor, Dave Alexander, said, “We encourage the public to view our website and follow our social media pages in the coming weeks for updates on suggested viewing areas. We will be hosting the vintage-themed registration on March 19 at the V&A Waterfront.” Beneficiaries of the Cape 1000 include the Motorsport Legends Benevolent Fund and Quadpara Association of South Africa.
