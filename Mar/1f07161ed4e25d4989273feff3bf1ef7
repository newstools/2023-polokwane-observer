Mille-feuille, which translates to “thousand sheets” in French, has been a staple in French patisseries for centuries. The pastry is made by layering thin sheets of buttery puff pastry, baked to golden perfection, with a smooth and creamy filling of vanilla pastry cream. The pastry cream is made by cooking milk, eggs, sugar, and cornstarch until thickened and fragrant, and then flavoured with vanilla bean or extract. Traditionally, mille-feuille is finished with a dusting of powdered sugar or a glaze of fondant icing. However, modern variations often include toppings such as fresh fruit, whipped cream, or chocolate ganache. The pastry is best served chilled and can be enjoyed as a decadent dessert or a luxurious afternoon snack. Despite its reputation for being a complex pastry, making mille-feuille at home is relatively simple and requires only a few ingredients. However, achieving the perfect balance of flaky pastry and silky filling can be a challenge. Nevertheless, once you take a bite of this heavenly pastry, you’ll understand why it’s worth the effort.
