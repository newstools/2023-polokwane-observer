POLOKWANE – A majority of people who genuinely love sports dedicate years of their lives to excel in it. Annaline Williams (19), who wears jersey number two for the Westax Development Rugby Club, is one of those people. Well-spoken of by her coaches, Williams seems to be a promising player with a lot to achieve and learn about rugby, because she aspires to play for the senior national female rugby team one day. “She started in 2019 and has continued to improve ever since. I am incredibly proud of her because she is focused on achieving excellence and her performance is a lot better now,” says coach Kaizer Adams.

She trains three times a week under supervision and once alone. Apart from rugby Williams likes to cook and looks forward to enroll for a hospitality course at a higher education institution to further her education and expand her skills.
