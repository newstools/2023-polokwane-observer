Meat-free Mondays are a great opportunity to explore delicious plant-based meals that are healthy, sustainable, and satisfying. This cannellini bean, fennel, apple, and roasted mushroom salad is a great example of a dish that is both flavourful and nutritious. The base of the salad is made with cannellini beans, which are an excellent source of plant-based protein and fibre, and fennel, which adds a crunchy texture and a subtle anise flavour. The salad is then topped with slices of tart green apple, which adds a refreshing burst of sweetness and acidity, and meaty roasted mushrooms that are packed with umami flavour.
