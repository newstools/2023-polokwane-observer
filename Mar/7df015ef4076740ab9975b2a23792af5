The 63-strong female jury for the Women’s Car of the Year contest, created by Sandy Myhre, voted the Citroen C5 X the Women’s Car of the Year in the Best Large Car category. There are five other categories and the C5 X will compete against the winners of those. The final winner of the overall WWCOTY award will be announced on March 8. The C5 X is a true invitation to travel in complete serenity. It offers cutting-edge technologies to simplify life on board, including the extended heads up display screen, or a brand new MyCitroën Drive Plus information system with natural speech recognition and a 12-inch touch screen. The C5 X is also perfectly integrated in Citroën’s energy transition by offering a rechargeable hybrid version 180 ë-EAT8 that complements the rechargeable hybrid 225 ë-EAT8 which already produces 60% of the C5 X mix.
