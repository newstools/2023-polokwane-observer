POLOKWANE –  Fitness bunnies showed off their retention strength during the Class of 2023 aerobics marathon at Nirvana community hall last Saturday. Members of Top Class Wellness Club from across Limpopo, joined the Polokwane group in a competition testing their limits, following instructed dance workouts and correlated gym clothing. In exchange, the best performers were awarded trophies and prizes including Mr and Miss Top Class 2023. The accolades were merely gestures of encouragement, as according to the founder, Peter Lebidi. Lebidi, who also was on the instructors’ roll, says such a competition creates or revives commitment for those who would either like to start but are deterred by reasons only known to them, or those who have lost hope in the course of physical exercise and leading a healthy lifestyle. “We deal with a variety of people, facing different physical challenges correlated with their psychology. So our duty is to push them individually based on their specific needs. Instructors encourage that each person should workout at their own level of strength without looking over to their neighbours. At the end of the day, people leave the marathon feeling capable of leading a physically active lifestyle with no shared pressure,” Lebidi explains. His words manifested in the age and gender variety pool that took part in the marathon. Both young and old, women and men with obviously very stretched health, psychological and physical ailments attested to the glory similar programmes have brought in the past. “I gave birth six months ago and use aerobics to keep post-parturm away and also to strengthen abdominal muscles. The marathon gave me hope because I met a lady from Lebowakgomo who went through the same thing in 2021 but is in pleasing shape. I am so excited to continue with my journey,” says Adrina Dipela, a member.
