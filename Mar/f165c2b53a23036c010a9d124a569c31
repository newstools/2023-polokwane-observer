Hybrid technology is, by many, considered to offer the best of both worlds. The electric motor in the vehicle is charged by the conventional fuel-driven engine and it offers excellent fuel efficiency. Buyer interest and the sales of hybrid cars are at an all-time high. “Hybrid cars have been around for some years now. The first hybrid launched in South Africa was the Toyota Prius back in 2005. That said, as an industry, we are in the process of transitioning into a market that is geared and prepared for new energy vehicles at scale. Hybrid vehicles, which, thanks to the escalating fuel price, are now more popular than ever before, offer a bridge to electric powertrain modes of transport. But there’s little research into the hybrid market available to the industry,” explains AutoTrader CEO, George Mienie.  A recent survey by AutoTrader about consumer behaviour relating to hybrid vehicles revealed a lot of interesting data about the new energy vehicle market. Hybrids are still very much an unknown for many potential buyers. More than 60% of South African consumers have never experienced a hybrid car while fewer than 5% have owned one. Here are just some of the interesting findings of this report: Respondents were also questioned about their expectations in terms of the charging times and range capabilities they require from a hybrid car. The report concluded that there is still much education to be done by all the relevant stakeholders to facilitate the adaptation of hybrid and new technology vehicles. Source: Nikki Chennells
