POLOKWANE – The appointment of former Mayor of Polokwane, Thembi Nkadimeng as Minister of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) came as no surprise as she comes from a background of serving local government nationally as the Deputy Minister of the same department as well as President of the South African Local Government Association (Salga). Parks Tau, who is also a former Deputy Minister of Cogta and Mayor of Johannesburg as well as president of Salga and Zolile Burns-Ncamashe will assist Nkadimeng as deputy ministers.
