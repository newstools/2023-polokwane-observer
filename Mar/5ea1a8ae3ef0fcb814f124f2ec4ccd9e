The Huracan Sterrato is based on the Huracan EVO and is fitted with a range of upgrades to make it more suitable for off-road driving. The suspension has been raised by 47 mm, and the car has been fitted with specially-designed off-road tires that provide excellent traction on rough terrain. The exterior of the car has also been modified to make it more rugged, with protective skid plates and larger fender flares. In the snow video, the Huracan Sterrato can be seen driving through deep snowdrifts and across frozen lakes with ease. The car’s powerful V10 engine provides plenty of power, and the all-wheel-drive system ensures that it maintains excellent traction in even the slipperiest conditions. While the Lamborghini Huracan Sterrato is not designed for serious rock crawling or extreme off-road driving, it is capable of tackling a wide range of terrain that would be impossible for most sports cars. With its high ground clearance and all-wheel-drive system, it is a true all-terrain machine that can handle everything from muddy trails to snow-covered roads. Overall, the snow video of the Huracan Sterrato is an impressive display of the car’s capabilities in challenging conditions.
