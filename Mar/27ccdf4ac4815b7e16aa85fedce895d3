POLOKWANE – TikTok has become the most popular app in the world with over one billion users worldwide. The short-form video hosting service first made an appearance in 2016 but blew up during the Covid-19 lockdown. But as with any other app, usage and time spent on the app can be unhealthy and there have been many discussions over the harm caused by social media use by younger people. To combat this, TikTok announced that it would be limiting usage time for users under the age of 18. “In the coming weeks, every account belonging to a user below 18 will automatically be set to a 60-minute daily screen time limit. While there’s no collectively-endorsed position on the ‘right’ amount of screen time or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital in choosing this limit,” a statement on their website reads. If the 60-minute limit is reached, TikTok said teens will be prompted to enter a passcode in order to continue watching, requiring them to make an active decision to extend that time. “For people in our u/13 experience, the daily screen time limit will also be set to 60 minutes and a parent or guardian will need to set or enter an existing passcode to enable 30 minutes of additional watch time,” the statement added. With this in mind, Polokwane Review asked learners at Curro Heuwelkruin and THS Tom Naudé, between the ages of 12 and 16, what they thought of the restriction.
