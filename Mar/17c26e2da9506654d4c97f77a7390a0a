Shaving forms part of our basic grooming, and occasionally we wonder, or argue with friends, about the task and its effects. For example, will shaving your legs remove your hard-earned tan? We take a close look at the fact and fiction surrounding shaving to clear it up once and for all:  Fiction! When you shave, you remove the hair on the surface of the skin which does not affect the hair’s colour or thickness. This is controlled by our genes, so blame your hairy ancestry.  Fiction! Provided your tan is real. Tanning occurs in the body’s pigment cells, in the lower levels of the skin which razors cannot reach. It would be a bloody mess if they did. However, shaving may reduce the longevity of a fake tan which is applied on the surface of the skin.  Fiction! A sharp new razor is the best option for your shave. A used razor with a dull blade, requiring more pressure, is likely to tug on the skin, causing nicks.  Fact! Don’t share your razor. It is common to get cuts when shaving, and when you use someone else’s razor, you risk a spread of warts, fungal infections and staph bacteria. No argument here.  Fact! To avoid razor bumps and ingrown hair, shave in the direction of hair growth. This ensures a close shave without irritation. So, no need to pick at the ingrown hair with a pin. To help  relieve the dry, itchy skin associated with new hair growth and to help prevent razor bumps, ingrown hair and irritation, why not try our fave FINO Soothe MAN (R75.00) after every shave.  Fiction! Shaving creams, oils and gels are designed to moisturise and help your razor glide across your skin more easily. Soap is made to cleanse and dries out the skin. We love FINO MAN Beard Oil (R150.00) for a close shave and soft, nourished skin.
