Suping said the boy child is being kept at a safe place after IPID’s application to remove the child from the family home was granted by the Groblersdal Children’s Court on February 13. Internal police processes have already been implemented following the woman’s arrest on January 20 and will run parallel with the criminal investigation that has been taken over by IPID. Suping said the case has been remanded to May 3 to allow for further investigation.
