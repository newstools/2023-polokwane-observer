Privateers Red-Lined Motorsport won the FIA T1 Class at the 2023 Dakar, and now they introduce the ultimate Rally Raid racing machine. They have developed the Revo T1 for its 2023 Rally Raid attack. “Our all-new Red-Lined Revo T1+ blends the Dakar winning strength and reliability of our T1-winning VK Series racecars with the performance, speed and agility of our later generation Revo T1. Best of all, it’s all wrapped up in the new T1+ spec big wheels and long-travel suspension to deliver the ultimate non-factory FIA Dakar T1+ class racer,” Red-Lined’s CEO, Terence Marsh, said.  “All four of our VK series racecars successfully finished the 2023 Dakar, coming home in first, second, fourth and fifth overall in the T1 class. Our T1-spec Revo has meanwhile been in great form against the finest Rally Raid crews in the South African championship. Red-Lined Motorsport has thus utilised its collective knowledge to build the Revo T1+.” If you want one, it can be ordered with either a tried and tested and non-complicated normally aspirated V8 VK56 engine, or the more sophisticated 3.8-litre GT-R twin turbo V6 engine. Whatever your choice, it uses a MOTEC engine management system with dual radiator, alternator and battery systems.  It comes equipped with a Sadev six-speed sequential gearbox and all-wheel drive system, a full 350mm FIA T1+ specification Rieger double-shock absorber suspension on each corner and rides on 37-inch BFGoodrich KDR2+ tyres and Evo Coarse 17-inch wheel rims fitted together with water-cooled PowerBrake callipers all round. “This new T1+ car is basically a rally raid supercar designed to be the ultimate non-factory T1+ racer available anywhere,” said Marsh. “It is fast enough to take on the factory teams, yet economical and practical enough to race with a reasonably sized team and budget. The Red-Lined Revo T1+ is 100% targeted at professional race teams and businessman drivers around the world.” Source: MotorsportMedia / Photos: Anton Wannenburg
