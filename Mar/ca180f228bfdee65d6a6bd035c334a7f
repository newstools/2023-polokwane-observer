POLOKWANE â€“ A total of 4 461 home owners were successful in their applications for indigent help in the 2022/23 financial year, the Polokwane Municipality confirmed. This intervention is guided by a municipal policy which exhonorates certain households from and qualifies others to receive assistance in paying for basic services due to a number of factors that revolve around proving that one is not financially capable to do so. Following years of tariff bill accumulation and non-payment, these families were informed in January that their applications have been approved. Prior, many had complained about their services being disconnected as the debt ran into hundreds of thousands of rands. Of the 7753 applications, 3054 were unsuccessful while others are still pending verification. The call for indigents to apply for assistance remains open, the municipality confirmed. Municipal communications head, Matshidiso Mothapo encourages those who require assistance to do so forthwith.
