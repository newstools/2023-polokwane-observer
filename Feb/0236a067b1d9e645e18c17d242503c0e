The dog owner who appeared in court last week, was released on R500 bail, his legal counsel, Adv Makiba Mabotja confirmed. The victim this week narrated that the attack occurred as she was making her way to the police station to have certain documents certified, when the incident occurred. “One of the dogs came running and attacked me from the front, and I could not keep track of what happened until some motorists from the 17:00 traffic jam started gathering around me and called emergency services personnel,” she told Polokwane Observer. She has not confirmed whether she would approach the civil court for the settlement of her medical costs. Last week, the family of the dog owner, whose name is withheld due to legal reasons said there is a double entrance system at the gate in Van Warmelo Street to ensure the animal remains in the yard. On January 31 at around 17:00, however, as a young girl approached the gate to greet her father (who is not the dog’s owner) who had come to pick her up, the dog escaped through the first gate, only to seconds later slip through the gate closest to the street. The dog proceeded to attack a female passerby, upon which the girl’s father and another passerby immediately intervened to get her to safety, sources close to the incident told Polokwane Observer.
