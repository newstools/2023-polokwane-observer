Tissue boxes are often seen as disposable and single-use items. However, with a little bit of creativity and imagination, tissue boxes can be transformed into beautiful and functional crafts that can add a touch of uniqueness and style to your child’s bedroom. Here are four craft ideas that you and your child can make together using tissue boxes. One of the most practical and useful crafts you can make from a tissue box is a study desk organiser for your child. Cut the top off the tissue box, cover it with wood grain decorative paper or fabric, and let your child use it to store items such as pens, pencils, paperclips, and other school supplies. Your child can also add some embellishments like ribbon, buttons, or stickers to make it look more attractive, and even insert pieces of cardboard to make partitions to separate different stationery. This simple yet effective craft will not only help your child keep their desk organised, but it will also add a pop of colour and personality to their study space. Another fun craft you and your child can make from a tissue box is a flower vase. Cut the top off the tissue box and let your child paint it in a colour of their choice. Once the paint has dried, add some floral foam to the bottom of the box, and then arrange flowers inside. You can use real or artificial flowers, depending on your child’s preference. This is a great way to add some greenery to your child’s bedroom and recycle a tissue box at the same time. A tissue box can even be transformed into a toy car. Cut the tissue box down to the size your child wants for their car, paint it in their desired colour, and then help your child add some details, such as wheels, headlights, and a license plate. You can use cardboard, felt, or foam sheets to make the wheels and other details, and you can also use markers, stickers, or other embellishments to decorate the car. A tissue box picture frame is another great craft idea. Cut the top off the tissue box, cover it with decorative paper or fabric, and then glue a photo to the front. You can also help your child add some embellishments like ribbon, buttons, or stickers to make it look more attractive. This craft is a great way to showcase your child’s favourite photos and add some personality to their bedroom décor.
