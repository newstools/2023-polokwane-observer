POLOKWANE – The Limpopo Provincial Government hopes for a 70% completion rate in the replacing of asbestos roofs in affected Seshego households by the end of March. The project has in the past seen multiple delays. On February 14, Human Settlements MEC, Basikopu Makamu announced that the roofs of 327 out of 1 500 households had been replaced. Basikopo Makamu conducted an oversight visit on the day, joined by Polokwane Mayor John Mpe and members of the Human Development Agency. He said a request has been made for the contractor to increase the workforce in order to reach the newly agreed timeline. The initial delay, according to Makamu, related to requesting and receiving consent from household owners. Another delay was brought about by the requirement of specific asbestos removal experts, who have since been appointed. Asbestos roofing is found to be the main cause of the asbestosis (a lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibres) and the use, import and manufacturing thereof was banned in 2008.

Makamu expressed concern that the rain may further delay the project. The 60-year-old resident, Ezekiel Moloto, who has been living at his house since he was a child, said he was satisfied with the progress made. “My family was concerned about the asbestos roof because it had been damaged by a hailstorm. It was leaking, and water soaked into the drywall. “I used to have a persistent cough when sleeping at night because of this roof, but now that the government has removed it, I can sleep peacefully. I am thankful for what the government has done for my home.”
