POLOKWANE – The Chief Operations Officer of Polokwane City Football Club, Tincy Tema said the team will use their Nedbank Cup match against Chippa United as a yardstick to test their strength against top opposition. City will lock horns with the Premier Soccer League (PSL) outfit at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium on February 14. Tema says their focus is on getting an automatic promotion to the PSL but that they will honour the fixture. “The Nedbank Cup is not a priority for us. Our focus is getting back into the PSL but we will approach the match professionally. We will field a strong team for continuation so that the players can gel well and get stronger ahead of our league matches.” Chippa United, led by Morgan Mammilla, formerly with Baroka Football Club, have been up and down this season. The Eastern Cape based outfit were Nedbank Cup finalists in 2021, the closest they have come to lifting the trophy, though they have been to three semifinals since 2017 and clearly enjoy this competition. They exited at the hands of second-tier University of Pretoria in the last 32 last year and will hope there is no repeat against Polokwane City. Tema has called all their fans to come in numbers to rally behind the team. “It is a night game and the gates will open early and we would like to see fans rallying behind the team.”
