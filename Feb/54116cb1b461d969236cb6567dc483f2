MOKOPANE residents came together as part of the #MyMokopane Action to clean the town. The rainy weather didn’t stop a group of residents last Saturday when they rolled up their sleeves to clean the police station and the corner of Thabo Mbeki Drive and Geyser Street. People from different backgrounds, pastors, business owners, teachers, public service members and learners with their parents, joined the first #MyMokopane project for 2023. #MyMokopane envisions a Mokopane that is clean, safe and beautiful for our children and communities to live in. A place we can be proud of. The idea was born from the “Broken Window Theory”. The Broken Window Theory states that visible signs of neglect, brokenness and crime, among others, encourage further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. A successful strategy for preventing vandalism, according to the authors of this study, is to address the problems when they are small. Repair the broken window within a short space of time, say, a day or a week, and the tendency is that vandals are much less likely to break more windows. Clean up the sidewalk every day, and the tendency is for litter not to accumulate (or for the rate of littering to be much less). Change is never easy, but we realised that our actions could be part of the change we want to see around us. By coming together as a community, with what we have available we can take responsibility for the improvement of our town. This is an excellent opportunity to grow our citizens and children in taking responsibility for their lives and our environment. When we all work together, we can make Mokopane the beautiful town we want it to be. If you want to join the movement, you can follow the ‘Love My Mokopane‘ Facebook page. #MyMokopane comes together once a month on a Saturday morning from 07:00-10:00 to conduct planned projects within the Mokopane area.
