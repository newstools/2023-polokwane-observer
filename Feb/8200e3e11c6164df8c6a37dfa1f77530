POLOKWANE – Stan Molokomme believes that while his products are common, they represent progress and self-sustainability. Stan is the managing director of Stan Confectionery and sells baked goods to the public including melting moments, scones, rusks, banana bread, cupcakes, muffins and cakes. He told the Review-Observer that his business was established in late 2020 and started with him experimenting in the kitchen as a result of Covid-19 lockdown boredom. “I found recipes on the internet and played around with them and developed a love for it. I realised that I could apply the knowledge I acquired from the quality management position I held to make something of it. Stan mostly sells from home but you can also find him in the mornings (Monday to Friday) on the corner of Witklip and Vermikuliet Street in Ladanna. He says social media has been helpful as that is where his target market is found and since the business’ inception, sales and exposure have picked up. “Stan Confectionery now supplies grocery and convenience shops in Polokwane with our baked goods and we even have an electronic swiping machine to make things more convenient for our customers,” he said. Stan hopes to see his business grow and turn into a sizeable corporate company to empower and employ the youth. He can be found on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok
