Hybrids pair an electric motor and a battery with an internal combustion engine (ICE), and they work together to boost efficiency and keep emissions low. The ICE sends power to charge the battery pack, and energy from braking is captured and stored as energy. In this way, they are ‘self-charging’. Most good hybrids include a choice of power modes ranging from eco to power. Unlike pure electric vehicles (EVs), you won’t have to worry about running out of battery because the ICE always ensures there is sufficient power unless the system is a plug-in derivative (PHEV).

Below are some pros and cons which you should consider before buying a hybrid car. Some older hybrid models had experimental features which failed, and their batteries deteriorated quickly, such as the Honda Accord Hybrid in 2005, and SUV Hybrids by GM in 2008. Since that advent, hybrid technology has improved significantly. “If you’re going to choose a hybrid model, it’s advisable to choose a newer model with the latest technology to avoid reliability issues,” concludes Smit.
