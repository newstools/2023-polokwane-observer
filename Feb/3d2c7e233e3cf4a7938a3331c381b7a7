In light of today being International Epilepsy Day, we take a closer look at how this disorder presents in children. Childhood epilepsy (also called seizure disorder) is a neurological disorder that affects children and causes seizures. Seizures are sudden changes in behaviour or movements due to a burst of electrical activity in the brain. Signs and symptoms of childhood epilepsy can vary depending on the type of seizure. Some common symptoms include staring spells, muscle spasms, loss of consciousness, and convulsions. Other symptoms may include confusion, instability, and changes in mood or behaviour. Sometimes, a child may experience changes in sensation or perception, such as seeing or hearing things that aren’t there. Diagnosis of childhood epilepsy typically involves a comprehensive evaluation by a neurologist, including a thorough medical history, physical examination, and a review of the child’s symptoms. Additionally, a neurologist may order a variety of tests, including an EEG (electroencephalogram), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), or CT (computed tomography) scan to help diagnose the condition. Treatment for childhood epilepsy often involves a combination of medication and lifestyle changes. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the most common treatment for childhood epilepsy and are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. Some children may require more than one medication to manage their condition effectively. Additionally, a child’s doctor may recommend changes to their diet, such as the ketogenic diet, which has been shown to reduce seizures in some children effectively. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat childhood epilepsy. This may involve removing the portion of the brain that is causing the seizures or implanting a device that helps to control seizures. The type of surgery that is best for a particular child depends on several factors, including the type of epilepsy they have, their age, and the location of the seizures. Other treatments for childhood epilepsy may include physical therapy, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. These treatments can help children with epilepsy develop new skills, improve coordination, and gain confidence. They can also help children with epilepsy manage the side effects of their condition and improve their overall quality of life.
