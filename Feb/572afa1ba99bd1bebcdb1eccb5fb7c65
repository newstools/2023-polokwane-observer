POLOKWANE – The Limpopo Softball Association (LSA) will host the inaugural Top 8 Tournament in Polokwane on February 25. The tournaments will reward winners with medals, trophies for individual performance and prize money yet to be announced. The eagerly-awaited competition was supposed to have been played on February 4 but was postponed following torrential downpours that left the playing surface overwhelmingly drenched. The tournament features all the eight teams that concluded the league season in the top eight bracket. Leading the pack is table toppers, Moletlane Texas, Lebowakgomo Wild Beasts, Mamaolo Rebels, Mahwelereng Spikes, Naledi Spiders, Seshego Raiders, Motlolo Roots and Mankweng Pioneers. With so much at stake, this two-legged tournament has all the hallmarks of a swashbuckling sporting extravaganza. Benny Boshomane, executive member of LSA said softball fans have been longing for action and this competition will be the perfect treat. “This tournament is what fanatical softball fans want to watch. We are expecting a huge capacity crowd to come and watch talented players in action. It’s been a while since our province staged a tournament of this magnitude. We are praying for good weather perfect for an outdoor event,” Boshomane said. “We have seen great action during the league season and this time the standard will be higher. This tournament will provide the perfect opportunity for some of our players who will be preparing for the National Provincial Championships to be played in Durban next month. Furthermore, we have other international events under the World Baseball Softball Confederation and this tournament should be a preparatory event for the boys.”
