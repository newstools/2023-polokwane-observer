For those who have woken up to the holiday a little too late to secure a booking at a romantic restaurant, there are still many ways to create a memorable night-in to celebrate Valentine’s Day. It might be difficult for homeowners to find the spare cash for an elaborate night out, especially after the latest interest rate hike. Spending the night at home can help couples save some money and create lasting memories in their own home. RE/MAX of Southern Africa shares some inspiration for the couples who would like to create some romantic memories within their own home: Gift them with a room makeover If your partner has been dreaming about redoing a room in the house, why not surprise them by tackling the project while they are out at work? Put a bow on the door or lead them into the house blindfolded for an extra layer of surprise. Tackle a project together If your significant other is not the type for surprises, why not tackle a renovation project together? This only works if you are both into home renovations, but it can be a great bonding experience and provides an opportunity to spend quality time together – not to mention that it could also end up adding value to your home. To add to the atmosphere, make sure to have some great snacks to nibble on and a romantic playlist going while you work. Dinner under the stars One thing load-shedding prepared us for is a romantic candle-lit dinner. Grab some candles or set a table in the backyard. Cook your partner’s favourite meal or, for those who are not the greatest chefs, order in from your partner’s favourite restaurant. Game night marathon Indulge your inner child by building a romantic fort in your living room and kit it out with fairy lights, snacks, and loads of cushions. Grab some board games and spend the evening in your own little world that you created for your significant other.
