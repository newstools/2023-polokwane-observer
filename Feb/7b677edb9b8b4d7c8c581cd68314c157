Whether you are an experienced wine drinker or just starting to explore a whole new world of wine, you wouldn’t want to miss your chance at some of the finest wines from across the world. The 2023 Strauss & Co Fine Wine Rhône-themed auction is one of our finest line-ups yet, featuring iconic producers from France, South Africa and the New World. Located in the south-eastern part of France, the Rhône Valley is known for its rich history and diverse range of wine styles. The region’s vineyards are situated along the banks of the Rhône River, where the Mediterranean and Continental climates collide, creating the perfect growing conditions for some of the world’s most sought-after wines.  The reds wines from the steep northern Rhône vineyards are made Syrah or Shiraz, the likely birthplace of this noble variety. The flatter and hotter south is predominantly Grenache and home to Chateauneuf-du-Pape, the oldest French wine appellation. In 1923 winemaking regulations were written into French law for the first time to combat fraud and protect the region’s image.  The warm growing conditions produce robust, rich and complex wines that have the ability to age for many decades. The white wines of the Rhône Valley are made from a blend of Viognier, Roussanne, and Marsanne grapes, producing crisp wines with notes of citrus and stone fruit. The New world is highly successful with Rhône valley varieties, with the Shiraz-based Penfolds Grange from Australia, becoming one of the world’s most iconic wines.  South Africa’s top producers have also had major success with Rhône varieties, considering the Swartland wines from Mullineux Family, Sadie Family, Porseleinberg and AA Badenhorst. Leading producers from Stellenbosch Hartenberg, de Trafford, Boschkloof and Rust en Vrede, as well as Luddite, Cederberg and Saronsberg complete an incredible line-up. The French list is possibly more definitive, featuring the iconic names that have built the Rhône Valley’s fine image. Vintage wines from Jaboulet La Chapelle, Guigal’s La Landonne  La Mouline and La Turque, Michel Chapoutier, Chateau de Beaucastel, Domaine Chave, Vieux Telegraph, Henri Bonneau and more, are on auction. A number of small mixed cases from the 1990s and 2000s should offer good value alongside these most prestigious wines.
