POLOKWANE – Without a doubt, the one thing you will find at every church bazaar or flea-market is a milktart. As we celebrate National Milktart Day today (February 27), the Polokwane Observer did some digging to find the history of this well loved treat. Different sources have different dates of when the milktart originated, most suggest that it was between the 15th and 17th century when the Dutch settlers in South Africa made it. Milktart consists of a buttery crust with a custard filling made of milk, flour, sugar and eggs and is topped off with a sprinkle of cinnamon. But what makes a milktart quintessentially South African is that everyone has their own way of making it and their own preference. Crustless milktarts are becoming the in-thing and you can even make a milk tart macaron. A ‘melktertjie’ is a shot that is a favourite in bars across the nation and there are many recipes written in cookbooks all over South Africa. Milktarts can be made up to two days before an event and kept in the fridge for up to three days. It can be served cold or at room temperature. Recipe: (Source: allrecipes.com) Ingredients:
