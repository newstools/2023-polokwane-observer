There are few desserts more quintessentially South African than the good old Milk Tart. It is omnipresent at every church bazaar, school fete, home industry outlet, supermarket and bakery, so it’s no surprise then to know that it has its very own day – February 27 – on the South African calendar. Milk tart, or Melktert as it was originally known, was brought to the country by the Dutch settlers in the Cape in the 1600s and is said to have been adapted from a recipe for Mattentaart which was listed in Thomas van der Noot’s book, Een Notabel Boexcken van Cokeryen (A Notable Book of Cookery), published in 1514. Given its long history, its little surprise that there are countless recipes and variations of the milk tart and there is even a whole recipe book dedicated to this delicious pastry (The South African Milk Tart Collection by Callie Maritz & Mari-Louis Guy), which was published in 2017. In honour of the day, we asked the chefs from Capsicum Culinary Studio to give us their favourite Milk Tart recipes and here’s what they sent us… ~ Capsicum Culinary Studio Pretoria campus ~ Capsicum Culinary Studio Durban campus   To assemble: Pour the still warm custard into the baked pastry shell ensuring that it spreads evenly. Allow to set and cool completely. In a bowl finely grate the Peppermint Crisp and mix with the ground cinnamon and then sprinkle over the top of the tart. You can use a stencil to make it look even more fabulous! ~ Capsicum Culinary Studio Cape Town campus  To assemble: Spoon the milk tart mixture into a piping bag and fill the choux buns.
