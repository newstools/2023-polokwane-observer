With popular hatchback nameplates garnering a reputation for themselves and the manufacturers who brought them to life over the past few decades, many are being put out to pasture in favour of SUVs. South Africa has now added another model to this ever-growing list. The Kia Rio will now join the likes of the Nissan Micra and Ford Fiesta â€“ models which are no longer offered on sale locally. In South Africa, the South Korean manufacturer has enjoyed sales success over its four generations but the unreleased fifth-generation model will not make its way to local shores. Kia will not manufacture the hatch in right-hand drive format which means markets like South Africa, Australia and the UK will not receive the newcomer. With the B-segment hatchback constantly losing out to its SUV sibling; the Sonet, in terms of monthly sales, it makes little sense to argue otherwise. Reports also suggest that the next-generation model will be budget-friendly, and focused on emerging markets. This means that after its fourth generation, it will cease to be sold in Europe too, despite its left-hand drive format. Kia South Africa will continue to sell the Rio for the remainder of the year, but their hatchback lineup will continue to be dominated by the smaller and more affordable Picanto which sells by the droves. This is a common occurrence in the South African context. There is still a short-term future for hatchbacks, however, they will more than likely exist in small and affordable packages that serve as an honest, basic fundamental of mobility.
