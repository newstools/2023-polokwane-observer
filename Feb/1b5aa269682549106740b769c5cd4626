The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado has been a popular SUV for years, known for its ruggedness and off-road capabilities. If rumours are true, Toyota might be applying the Tundra’s mechanical upgrades to the next-gen Prado, which means that it will be equipped with a more powerful engine, a stronger frame, and improved suspension if it reaches the production stage. Renders from DigiMode design suggest the beefy styling cues will be borrowed from the long-standing Toyota Tundra. The goal is to make the Prado even more capable of tackling tough terrain, hauling heavy loads, and providing a comfortable ride for passengers. The Toyota Tundra treatment includes a new 3.5-litre V6 engine, which will replace the current 2.8-litre four-cylinder engine. This means that the Land Cruiser Prado will have more power and torque, making it easier to climb steep hills and pull heavy trailers. The new engine is also believed to be more fuel-efficient, which is a plus for drivers who want to save money on fuel. Expected to launch in 2024, the Prado will most likely get a new frame, which is stronger and more durable than the current one. This will make the SUV more stable and less likely to sway when driving on rough terrain. The improved suspension will provide a smoother ride on bumpy roads. The Tundra treatment could be a big step forward for the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. It’s a smart move for Toyota to apply the Tundra’s mechanical upgrades to the Land Cruiser Prado, as it will make it a more competitive SUV in the market. With its ruggedness, off-road capabilities, and now, the Tundra treatment, the Land Cruiser Prado is sure to remain a favourite among SUV enthusiasts for years to come.
