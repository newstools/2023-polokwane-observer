POLOKWANE – During a sitting of the municipal council where the draft annual report for 2021/22 was adopted, Polokwane Municipality accepted the audit outcome wherein the municipality has moved from a qualified audit opinion to an unqualified audit outcome. Auditor-General (AG) Matshwenyego Rashokeng, however said that the opinion for the municipal entity, Polokwane Housing Association remains stagnant at unqualified with findings for the year ending June 2022. The AG emphasised that the municipality needs to improve on matters of financial and contract management. The unqualified audit opinion by the municipality confirms the promise made by Mayor John Mpe earlier in April 2022 during the institution’s strategic planning session when he said that the municipality was on the right path to achieve unqualified audit opinion. “We will work very hard to achieve an unqualified audit opinion. We are preparing nine months’ financial statements so that we can have an interim audit for the first time in order for us to do a pre audit before the real audit after the end of every financial year and I believe that the strategy has worked for us when I was still at Capricorn District Municipality. We will try to bring the AG earlier so that we can deal with emanating challenges within the remaining months and to gradually reduce a number of findings until we move towards a clean audit,” Mpe explained. “It is not going to be easy. Polokwane Municipality is the biggest municipality in the province with the highest volume of transactions. So we need to not only to fix our finances but our processes should also comply with policies that govern municipalities,” Mpe said.
