Ending an era of automotive prestige with a bang, Automobili Lamborghini has endowed two dystopian-Esque super sports cars with an outrageous 6.5-litre V12 affording the Auténtica and Invencible coupé with an output of 573kW and 720Nm at 6 750rpm. Before power hits all four tyres contacting the earth, a seven-speed ISR gearbox acts as a middleman between a sonorous 12-cylinder and four wheels, which are controlled by Lamborghini’s Dynamic Steering system. “The V12 engine is one of the pillars of our history and of the success of our brand and before we get into the full swing of Direzione Cor Tauri, we felt it was only right to celebrate the combustion V12 with two one-off cars that perfectly represent our concept of excellence in the sphere of customisation,” says Automobili Lamborghini chairman and CEO Stephan Winkelmann. Although sharing many similarities such as the same heart and body composition, the Invencible distinguishes itself from the Autentica in areas such as brake callipers, front splitter and rear wing, which on the Autentica, are finished in Rosso Mars (red). The rest of the body is finished in a bold red called Rosso Efesto accentuated by little details sporting a beautiful red flake. The iconic scissor doors feature two hexagonal tricolours which serve as a tribute to the Italian flag, which extends to areas such as the door linings and steering wheel. Both cars borrow many details from the firm’s most exclusive and high-strung models, such as the Sesto Elemento and the Reventón. “With these cars, the Lamborghini Centro Stile has expressed the utmost creativity applicable to the V12 platform; their design, elevated to a new level, best represents our unique DNA,” adds head of design Mitja Borkert.
