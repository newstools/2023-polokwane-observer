POLOKWANE – You too can become a literacy activist through the Nal’ibali funda leader initiative. A funda leader is a foot soldier who brings stories and books to children in the corner of the country. These heroes come in the form of teachers, parents, librarians and volunteers, as well as all book-loving individuals. Although anyone can be a funda leader, one needs to possess a specific set of qualities like having care and respect for children and wanting to help them learn. It requires fun and relaxed interaction with stories and being eager to share storytelling and reading know-how with others. Nal’ibali’s provincial coordinator Khomotso Reggy Letsoalo explained that they offer free online training courses covering topics such as how to tell and read stories out loud to children as well as how to plan, start and run a reading club. “All that’s required is for you to sign up to be automatically connected to the Nal’ibali network. This allows Nal’ibali to follow your journey and offer training and support for your literacy activities. The work will also be featured on their media network; hence they encourage sharing experiences on social media or direct contact with Nal’ibali,” he said. Nal’ibali connects with funda leaders around the country for collaborations, sharing ideas, joining bigger events and grow the network of literacy activists. From time to time, Nal’ibali will present exclusive offers and competitions to active funda leaders. “The most active funda leaders from across the country will also gather once a year for a celebratory event. Through these events, you can benefit from further resources like new books, promotional materials, gift vouchers and visits by well-known authors,” he added.
