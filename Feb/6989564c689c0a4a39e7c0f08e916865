Every milestone your baby reaches is exciting, but teething is the one that comes with the most challenges. Synonymous with sleepless nights, sore gums, irritable and miserable babies and therefore just as miserable mamas. Anyone who has ever had a baby will know that soothing and solving the teething disruption is a number one priority. February is designated as National Children’s Dental Health Month, a month-long observance aimed at promoting the importance of good oral health for children. During this month, dental professionals, educators, and advocates across the country work together to raise awareness about the significance of good oral hygiene and the impact it has on children’s overall health and well-being. The goal of National Children’s Dental Health Month is to encourage parents and caregivers to prioritise their children’s dental health and to educate them on the best practices for maintaining healthy teeth and gums. This includes brushing and flossing regularly, eating a balanced diet, and visiting the dentist for routine check-ups and cleanings. By promoting good oral health practices, National Children’s Dental Health Month helps to ensure that children grow up with strong, healthy teeth and gums, and the confidence to smile brightly. Teething is a natural process that occurs in infants and young children as their primary (baby) teeth start to emerge and push through the gums. The process typically begins around six months of age and continues until the child has a full set of 20 primary teeth, which usually occurs around age three. During this time, children may experience discomfort, irritability, and other symptoms as their teeth break through the gums. As the teeth begin to emerge, the surrounding gums may become swollen, red, and tender, and the child may experience pain or discomfort when biting or chewing. Some children also experience increased drooling, a decrease in appetite, and mild fever as their teeth come in. In addition, many children become more fussy and irritable during this time, which can make it difficult for parents to manage their symptoms. To help alleviate the symptoms of teething, parents can offer the child cold teething toys, teething rings, or washcloths to chew on. Some parents also find that massaging the child’s gums with a clean finger can help relieve discomfort. In addition, over-the-counter pain relievers and topical anaesthetics can also be used to relieve teething pain, but it is important to consult a paediatrician before giving any medication to a young child. Mothers are bombarded with loads of products that are quickly classified as necessities but don’t do the job. Choosing a teether can be overwhelming: what will my babe like best? Which shape is most beneficial, what material to choose, are there added benefits and what to avoid? Introducing GiliGums, baby teethers to help ease the pain of teething. Developed with speech therapists in Europe they ensure optimal oral development, while still being entertaining and ultimately soothing. GiliGums are 100% FDA-approved food-grade silicone, BPA -free and safe to put in microwaves, dishwashers, and other sterilizers. Baby is drawn to more pliable materials, so silicone teethers are a great choice. The Mushroom Teether, its distinct shape replicating the mother’s breast, is easy to hold, strengthens babe’s grip and improves spatial awareness. While soothing tender gums it also both calms and stimulates the baby’s senses. There is no doubt that it helps get babies through teething discomfort while exploring different senses, feelings, shapes and textures. “I really like this teether because it encourages the safe mouthing of objects, which is an important developmental skill,” says Catherine Barry on GiliGums Mushroom Teether. “Important oro-motor skills like side-to-side tongue movement and the development of the strength and precision of the oral structures involved in clear speech is encouraged by the use of this teether. This is also a good alternative to dummy use (which can negatively impact oro-motor development as well as the development of clear speech) while retaining the soothing and calming benefits.” Many moms don’t know when to start using teethers. According to Barry, as soon as your baby starts to put everything in their mouth you can hand them an easy-to-grip GiliGums teether, which you know is safe, has added sensory benefits while soothing those gums and babes will love it. Barry also recommends the following four points to keep in mind when shopping for a teether: Along with teething comes oral hygiene. The Giligums silicone toothbrushes in either a cactus or snail shape are also an excellent choice. These toothbrushes double as teethers and soothe with their soft bristles, which give aching gums the extra love that they need. Again, they are easy to grip and jumpstart healthy oral hygiene habits.   GiliGums makes the experience of teething a whole lot easier for mom and babe. As babies are desperate for relief from the teething pain, they want to bite, gnaw and soothe those irritated gums. Cutting teeth is a major milestone for every baby and painful, GiliGums is a silicone paradise for teething babies, making this milestone memorable in a far better way, whether it is to soothe those endless pains or begin the journey of oral hygiene.
