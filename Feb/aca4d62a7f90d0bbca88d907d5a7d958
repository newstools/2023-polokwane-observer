Chery reports that it saw a new record for global monthly sales which saw a total of 101 379 vehicles and recorded an export of over 50 000 units in one month. For eight months Chery has seen sales ranging in the 100 000 mark an has used this to predict another record setting sales year in 2023. “Our customer-centric focus is the reason our dealer footprint now spans every province in South Africa. We currently have 76 appointed dealers to better support our growing customer base and to improve accessibility to this amazing brand” explains JayJay Botes, the national sales manager for Chery. The latest offering in Chery’s local offerings is the Chery Tiggo 8 Pro Max which quickly garnered a significant following and demand.
