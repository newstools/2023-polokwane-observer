LIMPOPO – A group of grannies in Kutama Sinthumule outside Makhado is taking a stand against taboos, and living an active, healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Joseph Raphadana, the founder of SK Sports, Arts and Culture Community Development non-profit organisation started the soccer grannies in 2017 after seeing the need for a therapeutic release among elderly women. The grannies are aged between 60 and 80. He said the organisation was established in June 2017 and has started with only five soccer teams from Tshiozwi, Gogobole, Ravele, Madombidzha and Magau villages and targets elderly women. SK Sports, Arts and Culture has more than 50 granny football teams playing under a tournament organised by the organisation since they started organising grannies football. “It helps a lot of grannies through exercise, it keeps their body healthy and physically fit. Grannies football reduces stress too,” said Raphadana. Some of the teams will participate in a four-day World International Grannies Football Tournament this year in March at Nkowankowa Stadium organised by Mama Bheka Ntsanwisi. “The challenges we are facing now are running out of sports equipment such as soccer balls, kits, cones, bibs and first aid kits. We appeal to business people to sponsor our organisation,” he said. He told CV that the initiative was aimed at making elderly women feel included in society. “When you are an older person, people think that you are no longer important. So, this makes them celebrities in their communities. The organisation relied on donors to supply the teams with balls and kit to help teams that cannot afford to buy them for themselves. It is not about the money but the important thing is for us to get people who can sponsor balls, nets, and soccer boots for the grannies,” he said.
