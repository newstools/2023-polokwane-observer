Nasal congestion can be a real pain for babies and kids, making it difficult for them to breathe and get a good night’s sleep. Fortunately, there’s an easy and safe solution – nasal saline drops. A saline solution can help to thin and flush out mucus, relieving the stuffy nose and making breathing easier for your child. But before you start administering the drops, knowing the right way to do it is essential. Here’s how to give nasal saline drops to babies, toddlers, and older kids: Before you begin, make sure you have the following items: Use a clean cloth or tissue to remove mucus from your child’s nostrils. This will help ensure the saline solution can reach deep into the nasal passages. Use 1-2 drops of saline solution in each nostril for babies. Use 2-3 drops in each nostril for toddlers and older kids. To administer the drops, gently squeeze the bottle so the solution flows into the nostril. Keep your child’s head tilted slightly forward, and ensure the drops don’t go too far into the nostril. After administering the drops, wait 5-10 minutes to give the solution time to thin and loosen the mucus. Your child may sneeze a few times, which is normal and a good sign that the solution is working. Now it’s time to use the bulb syringe or nose aspirator to remove the mucus. For a bulb syringe, gently squeeze the bulb to create suction and then place the tip of the syringe in the nostril. Slowly release the bulb to suction out the mucus. For a nose aspirator, place the tip in the nostril and gently suction out the mucus. Repeat this process for the other nostril. Make sure to clean and disinfect the bulb syringe or nose aspirator after each use to prevent the spread of germs.
