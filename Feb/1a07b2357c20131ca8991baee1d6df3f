POLOKWANE – The SA Big 5k is not only a race for everyone, but it is a chance to improve your fitness and have fun doing it. The race takes place nationally from March 22 to March 25 throughout various cities and CrossFit Firebox will host the Polokwane leg of the race. There are three events throughout the year and at each event one lucky winner will be drawn and will win 15% of the national entry fees for that event. Twenty percent of all local entry fees will go to a charity of the hosts choice. Keep your diary open on March 25 as the fun will take place at The Ranch Resort outside Polokwane. It will be a dry start, meaning runners start on their own time between 7:00 and 8:15. It will be a trail run and entry fees are R50 per person and children under 13 years run for free. Your entry will also enter you into the national lucky draw. Online entries can be made here. An added bonus is that the popular King & Queen of the Bushveld CrossFit competition will also take place on the same day. All runners can head over to the competition to watch some of South Africa’s fittest athletes battle it out for R55 000 prize money. Food and drinks available as well.
