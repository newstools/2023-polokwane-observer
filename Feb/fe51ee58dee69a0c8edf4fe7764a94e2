The Mercedes-Benz A-Class recently received a mid-life refresh, offering subtle changes on both the sedan and the hatchback. In doing so the compact Benz, boasting its enhancements will enable it to compete with ultra-competitive rivals such as the Audi A3 Sportback/saloon and the BMW 1 and 2 Series. The Mercedes-Benz configurator has included the models with pricing accompanying the latest spec. With perfectly balanced overall proportions and high-quality attention to detail in its design, the latest generation of the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) and a model range that is rigorously geared to customer wishes, the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class brings something special to the compact segment and offers customers class, for every day. The high-performance Mercedes-AMG A-Class has also been facelifted; it will be offered in both A 35 4Matic and A 45 S 4Matic+ guise. The new Mercedes-Benz A-Class is a subtle evolution of the latest version that was introduced in 2018. The key upgrade at the front is a new set of LED headlights. They are simplified and boast a more modern aesthetic, with a cool LED strip running across the top which gives a distinctive daytime running light signature. The sporty character is underlined by externally flush wheels with four additional rim designs in sizes up to 19 inches, including optional high-gloss black painted light-alloy wheels in multi-spoke design and with a high-gloss rim flange for the AMG Line. The new rear diffuser and the standard LED rear lights ensure a fascinating and emotionally appealing appearance in both day and night. The high-class exterior is perfectly complemented by an attractive choice of exterior paintwork. A variety of non-metallic/metallic and MANUFAKTUR paint finishes are available. Exclusiveness is also reflected in the interior of the new A-Class. The absolute highlight is the standard freestanding dual-screen display with a seven-inch and the larger 10.25-inch display taking centre stage. Optional are two 10.25-inch displays that seem to float with their wide-screen look. The cabin also features cool ambient lighting and a revised steering wheel, wrapped in Nappa leather as standard. The new Mercedes-AMG A35 and A45 have an AMG-specific radiator grille and, for the first time, a bespoke AMG emblem badge on the bonnet instead of the Mercedes-Benz star with the laurel wreath. They also have a standard Mercedes-AMG Performance steering wheel inside, with dual rotating dials to select engine and handling modes. In the global lineup, the A-Class is offered in A180 or A200 petrol engine guise, an A200d diesel, and the A250e plug-in hybrid. The power of the electric motor has been increased by 5kW and now reaches a driveline power of 80kW. As far as charging is concerned, there are still three options available. In addition to the 3.7kW standard, the improved battery can now also be charged with alternating current with up to 11kW, instead of only 7.4 kW as before. The new A-Class also continues to offer the option of charging the battery with a direct current of up to 22kW. A DC charge from 10% to 80% takes around 25 minutes. The model range continues to comprise 100kW of power and 230 Nm of torque on the 1.3-litre turbo four-cylinder engine in the A180, a 2.0-litre turbo four-cylinder engine that produces 165kW of power 350 Nm of torque in the A250, and the 1.3-litre plug-in hybrid A250e that produces 160kW and 450Nm of torque.
