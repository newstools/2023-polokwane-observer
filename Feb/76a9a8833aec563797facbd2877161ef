POLOKWANE – The Limpopo police said they are determined to eradicate illegal mining activities through continued disruptive operations in affected areas of the province. This comes after a successful joint disruptive operation that resulted in the arrest of two suspected illegal miners, aged 37 and 48-years-old in Bergenek outside Polokwane last week. The joint operation was led by the acting Capricorn District Commissioner Brigadier Sivhula alongside the Westenburg Station Commander Lieutenant Colonel Pilusa. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspects were conducting illegal mining activities when the the team pounced on them and two suspects were arrested. “The other suspects managed to evade the arrest by fleeing the scene on foot. Pendukas, three generators, spades, soil extracts from the mines and corrugated iron was confiscated during the arrest,” his statement read. Mojapelo added that four suspects between the age of 19 and 38-years-old were also arrested during the operation for the contravention of the Immigration Act. “The six suspects will appear in the Polokwane Magistrate’s Court today (February 13). Police investigations continue,” he said.
