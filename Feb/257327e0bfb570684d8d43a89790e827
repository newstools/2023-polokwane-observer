Work will be done at the Nirvana pool as well.” He said they have erected a fence at the Polokwane Municipal Pool to safeguard it against vandals. “We secured the swimming pool after we received complaints in the past from the community members. This was done to ensure that users are safe.” Rob Anderson, the vice president of Limpopo Swimming Aquatics said they truly hope that the municipality can live up to its promise. “The pool is destroying itself. There is a leakage which results in the loss of thousands of litres of water. My advice to them is that they must get a technical report and get an engineer who can draw up the scope for the work to be done. They must focus on the filtration of water, and the pump house which needs to be replaced from start to finish. It is very important to refurbish the pump.”
