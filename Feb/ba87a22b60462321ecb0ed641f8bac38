POLOKWANE – Even though Greg Schoeman is a well-known figure around Noordskool, he was warmly welcomed on his first day as the new principal last week. He joined the school 15 years ago as a new teacher where he taught various subjects including Afrikaans, social sciences, English, natural sciences and creative arts. For the past three years he took on the role of HOD for the intermediate and senior phase, more specifically Gr 6 and 7 as well as for learning and teaching support material. “The best part is that I was once a learner at Noordskool and therefore have a very soft spot for the culture of the school.” Greg is a dad and a husband who believes teaching is the most rewarding job there is, as you can see a child develop and learn new skills. About his plans for the school he says he and his team will keep building on the foundation cemented so well by former principals.

Each has a specific way that makes a difference. We should keep on doing that because as a family we need each other to function well.”
