LIMPOPO – The police in Levubu have urged the community to inform them on the whereabouts of Nomthandazo Joseph Baskiti who is sought in connection with an attack on a family in Mashau-Bodwe which led to the death of a 78-year-old woman. Granny Marandela Mabasa, her daughter Idah (32) and three-year-old son, who was staying with them, were sleeping on the evening of the incident, when a person believed to be connected to Idah showed up at the house. According to reports, Mabasa opened the door and returned to her bedroom. According to Idah, the man went inside Mabasa’s bedroom, threatening to kill her if she did not tell him where she (Idah) was. “I was pleading with him to stop strangling my mother.” After attacking her mother, the attacker followed Idah outside where he stabbed her several times. The man then set the six-roomed house on fire before fleeing the scene, taking the child with him. Neighbours alerted the police, and tried to douse the flames. Both Mabasa and Idah were rushed to the Polokwane Provincial Hospital, but late on January 28, Mabasa succumbed to her injuries. Idah was discharged from the hospital two days later. A day before the incident, Baskiti was reportedly released on R500 bail after appearing in court on an assault charged Idah had laid a against him. The families have over the years held several meetings to intervene in the relationship. According to Limpopo police spokesperson, Brig Motlafela Mojapelo, a murder docket has been opened as well as that of attempted murder, arson, robbery and kidnapping. The investigation continues. He urged community members with information on Baskiti’s whereabouts to help them locate him. Granny Mabasa was buried at Mashau Bodwe on February 4.
