Plumbing Travelling Exhibitions (PTE) is fulfilling its commitment to “Go to the heart of the area” which was launched last year. Plumbing Travelling Exhibitions (PTE) will be in Polokwane at the Tom Naude Technical High School from 12:00 to 17:00  on 2 March 2023.  Look out for the yellow and red tents. If you have anything to do with plumbing and water, make sure you attend and engage with exhibitors. The concept is not new and allows for a relaxed opportunity to engage with each other on matters plumbing. The products on display will range from Septic tanks, hot water storage systems (Geysers), cold water storage tanks, local merchants, range of pipes and fittings for buildings, new products, valves and all products related to the plumbing and water sector. The Institute of Plumbing (IOPSA) will be hosting talks on Geyer and drainage fault finding, the cost of doing business and the learners from the plumbing part of the school will attend a special session on ‘Plumbing as a Career.” They will also be invited to visit the exhibition. Entrance is free. One either has to have an invite from a merchant or wholesaler or you can just arrive and register at the registration counter on the ‘B’ field at the school. For PIRB plumbers, one obtains two (2) CPD points for attending the exhibition and two (2) CPD points for attending the workshops. The workshops will require a separate registration at the PTE Workshop area within the exhibition area. You don’t want to miss this event.
