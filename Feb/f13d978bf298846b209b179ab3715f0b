POLOKWANE – Residents and businesses in parts of Ladanna and Nirvana will be without power due to electrical issues being attended to by the Polokwane Municipality. Municipal communications manager Matshidiso Mothapo said an electrical team is attending to a burnt mini substation in Ladanna and that Pietersburg, Klipdam and Tulip Streets are affected as a result. “The team will do their best to restore electricity as soon as possible,” his statement read. Meanwhile, the municipality is cutting trees overlapping electrical lines in the Nirvana area. “For this to happen, the technicians must switch off a block at a time in order for the trees to be cut to eliminate unnecessary power trips that the area often experiences,” Mothapo said. He added that the affected areas are advised to treat all electrical wiring as live during the outage and to switch off all appliances to avoid injury and damage when supply is restored. “Affected consumers are requested to exercise patience whilst the issues are being attended to,” he said.
