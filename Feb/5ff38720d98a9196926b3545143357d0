POLOKWANE – Anyone can start their education at the most fundamental levels, and progress to a level where they can obtain a matric certificate, as well as other abilities to enable them to apply for opportunities in the workforce with Abet centres. Centre manager of Rev MP Maltjie Community Learning Centre, Ouma Nkoana says the centre is there to make people aware of the opportunities they can unlock in their lives. The centre is located in Seshego Zone 5 at Alf Makaleng Primary School where it currently has 28 learners that have not been to school or have not completed their school education to get a chance to improve their literacy, numeracy, life orientation and other skills. Nkoana said it is concerning to see how many youngsters have dropped out of school and don’t have any formal education or knowledge of any skill. “As a product of Abet I know how important education is and for people who are sitting at home thinking they are too old or they can’t get any form of education, they have to know that there is such a centre in their community.” The centre is under Limpopo Community Education and Training and conducts teaching and learning programmes from Monday to Friday between 13:00-16:30. The learning subjects include mathematics literacy, life orientation, English, Sepedi, travel and tourism, auxiliary healthcare and early childhood development. She added that the centre has former learners who are now working and can feed their families and some who are business owners. Because many students come from disadvantaged backgrounds, donations such as sanitary towels, stationery, clothes and other materials are welcome. Nkoana can be contacted on 079 277 3606 if you would like to donate or receive any information about enrolling at the centre.
