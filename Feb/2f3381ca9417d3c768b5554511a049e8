The third and last race in the three-race Rotax Challenge was held at the iDube Racetrack in KwaZulu-Natal Midlands on Saturday, February 18. Many Gauteng and Cape competitors made the trip and provided entertaining racing on the day. Rotax racing, irrespective of conditions, is always spectacular, and many of these competitors made their intentions clear – and these were definitely non-negotiable. Jonathan Pieterse proved unstoppable in the changing and challenging weather conditions. He recorded three wins in three races in the masters’ event. Troy Snyman gave notice by beating Jozi visitor Ethan Bostander, Corban Spies and race 1 winner and reigning junior max national champion KC Ensor Smith from Gauteng two races to 1 to take senior max honours. Kent Swartz and Jonno Wilson thoroughly dominated the high school junior max battles, and Kent took two heats versus Jonno’s one. Kyle Spies was dominant in the U13 mini max. He took three race wins to keep Cape lad Keagan Beaumont and Jozi lass Emma Downing in check. Bev van Heerden beat her hubby Richard to max Masters honours ahead of Andrew Nivison. All attention now turns to the opening round of the Rotax Max Nationals when the rest of South Africa’s top karters make the trek to iDube for that important weekend, March 3 and 4. The top competitors in these races will represent South Africa in the Olympics of Karting grand finals. Source: MotorsportMedia / Photos: André Loubscher
