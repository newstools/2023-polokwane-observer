Chowders are huge crowd pleasers, but they can also make elegant starters at a sit-down dinner party – especially when served with the recently launched Spier Good Natured Chenin Blanc 2021. This certified organic wine’s vibrant quince, citrus, and peach notes gorgeously complement our chowder’s sweetness, while its crisp, zesty finish offers a deft counterpoint to its creaminess. A winning combo any time of year! Serves 4-6 Fresh Vadas sourdough, for serving *Allergic to shellfish? Replace sustainably sourced prawns can be replaced with a firm white fish like haddock. Spier Good Natured Organic wines can be tasted and purchased at the farm in Stellenbosch and online at shop.spier.co.za.
