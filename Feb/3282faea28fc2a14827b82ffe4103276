Mitsubishi has added the Eclipse Cross GLS Exceed to its range. Most striking about the Exceed is its coupé-like and high-tech design but it still offers SUV practicality. Under the bonnet It will be available in two variants: a 2.0 litre, MIVEC DOHC, 16-valve, four-cylinder engine that boasts 110kW and 198Nm and a 1.5-litre turbo offering 110kW and 250Nm. Power will be directed to the wheels through a highly efficient, eight-step INVECS-III CVT which incorporates a sports mode.  Safety Safety is top notch courtesy of its reinforced impact safety evolution body construction, seven airbags plus side-impact protection bars. Standard equipment includes Isofix child seat anchors, ABS with EBD, AYC (active yaw control), brake assist system, hill start assist system, active stability and traction control. Convenience features an electric parking brake, power steering, anti-theft protection and more. The Cross GLS Exceed also features an ultrasonic misacceleration mitigation system. It reduces the chance and severity of hitting obstacles four metres in front or behind, should a driver mistakenly press the accelerator when stationary or when travelling below 10km/h. “We believe that the Eclipse Cross continues to offer a great combination of a sleek, sporty design combined with SUV capabilities and the latest round of refinements go a long way in cementing its position as a vehicle that perfectly embodies what the Mitsubishi brand represents,” says Jeffrey Allison, general manager: marketing at Mitsubishi Motors South Africa (MMSA).  Pricing Pricing starts at R479 990 and includes a three-year/100 000km manufacturer’s warranty, a five-year unlimited mileage roadside assistance and a five-year/90 000km service plan.
