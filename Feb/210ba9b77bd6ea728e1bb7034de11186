Aspiring tennis players from different primary schools in the province took the Polokwane Tennis Court to battle for the spot in the Limpopo Junior tennis team at the Limpopo Junior Tennis tournament on January 21. The enthusiastic learners who were eager to be part of the team exchanged pin-point serves, aces, rallies and volleys on the courts. According to Ernest Faver, chairperson of Limpopo Junior Tennis said they had 100 tennis players from different schools across the province competing against each other on the day. “From the group we wanted 12 players that will make the Limpopo Junior Tennis team that will participate in the national IPT tennis tournament from March 25 to 29 in Bloemfontein. The team will be made of six girls and six boys.”
