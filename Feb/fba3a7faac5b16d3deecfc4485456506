Love the idea of shiny, healthy, summer curls but the reality is a frizzy, uncontrollable mess? The summertime humidity doesn’t do curly hair any favours, as all that extra moisture in the air is absorbed by your hair which increases each strand’s diameter and leads to that wild look. The good news is that with a little time and effort and a couple of key products, you can banish frizz and wear your curls with pride right through summer. Try these three tips: Activate your curls Summer calls for lighter products as you want to increase and maintain moisture levels without weighing down the hair. After washing your hair (with a sulphate-free shampoo to avoid stripping your hair of all those good, natural oils) followed by a hydrating conditioner, you want to add a lightweight curl cream. We love The Perfect Hair Curl Activating Gel (R99.95) as the gel helps to lock in moisture while also defining perfectly popping curls and coils. It also smells like summer, thanks to the yummy tropical scent! Speed up growth We all know that your hair benefits from a regular trim, which is especially true for curly hair as it helps to remove dry and split ends and to keep it healthy and bouncy.
