POLOKWANE – The South African Weather Service has issued a level 2 warning for disruptive rain in Polokwane.  The warning comes amid a cut-off low-pressure system sweeping across the Eastern half of the country, bringing with it heavy rain and thunderstorms. Earlier this week, the weather service said the system would be quasi-stationary from today (February 9) until Saturday (February 11) before dissipating on Sunday. “Due to the slow-moving nature of this cut-off low, persistent rainfall for several days may result in widespread flooding over the central, southern, and eastern parts of the country,” a statement read at the time. Today’s warning for Polokwane is effective from 12:00 to 23:59 this evening with a high likelihood but minor impact expected. The weather service said its impact could bring localised flooding of susceptible informal and formal settlements and low-lying roads. “Difficult driving conditions are expected due to wet roads or pooling of water on roads with possible minor vehicle accidents. Difficult driving conditions on dirt roads and closure of low-lying bridges and roads are also expected,” their website reads. They have warned people to stay indoors and off roads and to avoid crossing flooded roads and swollen streams where possible. “Where rising water levels are observed, move to high ground,” they said. AccuWeather’s forecast suggests an 82% chance of thunderstorms today, while a 55% chance of thunderstorms awaits this weekend.  Highs of between 23ºC and 26ºC are expected from today until Sunday.
