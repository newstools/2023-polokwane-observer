POLOKWANE – Water supply in the city will be affected by a planned shutdown of both the Ebenezer and Olifantspoort Plants by Lepelle Northern Water (LNW). The Ebenezer Plant will be shutdown on Wednesday (February 8) as well as March 8 for 24 hours. Municipal communications manager Matshidiso Mothapo said the stoppage at the Ebenezer plant is necessary for LNW to replace non-functional valves, construct chambers, install new valves and assess the meter on the main line. He added that pumping from the Olifantspoort Plant will be shutdown for 10 hours on February 28 to enable Eskom to switch off the Strydkraal 33 kilovolt line and connect a new package plant transformer. “Both shutdowns will affect all areas of supply within the Polokwane Municipality. The municipality will activate water tankers to assist all affected areas during the stoppages,” his statement read.
