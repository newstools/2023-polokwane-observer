The Toyota Corolla has been a mainstay in the automotive industry for decades, and the latest edition of the vehicle promises to offer enthusiasts something truly special. Toyota has recently announced that it will keep the exclusive GR Corrolla Circuit Edition trim around for another model year even though it was supposed to have a limited run and only be available in its debut year. Only 1 500 examples were made available in 2023, with numbers going through the roof, it is believed that the limited edition Corolla shifted the Japanese brand strategy. So, what makes the GR Corolla Circuit Edition so special? For starters, it’s a collaboration between two of Toyota’s most respected divisions – Gazoo Racing (GR) and Toyota Racing Development. These two entities have worked together to create a vehicle that is truly special, offering a unique blend of performance, style, and exclusivity. The first thing you’ll notice about the GR Corolla Circuit Edition is its striking exterior design. The vehicle features a bold, aggressive front fascia with a blacked-out grille and sleek LED headlights. The lower portion of the front bumper has been redesigned with a more aerodynamic profile, and the rear of the vehicle features a distinctive diffuser and quad exhaust tips. The car also sits lower to the ground than the standard Corolla, thanks to a sport-tuned suspension system. Under the hood, the GR Corolla Circuit Edition packs a punch. The vehicle is powered by a 1.3-litre three-cylinder turbocharged engine that produces an impressive power of 223kW and 400Nm of torque. This engine is paired with a six-speed manual transmission, providing drivers with full control over the vehicle’s performance. The interior of the GR Corolla Circuit Edition is just as impressive as the exterior. The vehicle features sports seats with red stitching and GR badging, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel. The infotainment system has been upgraded with an eight-inch touchscreen display, and the vehicle also comes with a premium JBL sound system. One of the standout features of the hot hatch is its exclusive circuit pack. This package includes a number of upgrades designed to enhance the vehicle’s performance on the racetrack. These upgrades include lightweight 18-inch BBS alloy wheels, high-performance Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tyres and a limited-slip differential. The circuit pack also includes a front brace and rear anti-roll bar, which improve the vehicle’s handling and stability at high speeds. The GR Corolla Circuit Edition is a truly impressive vehicle that offers a unique combination of performance, style, and exclusivity. With only a limited number of units being produced, this car will continue to be a hot commodity among automotive enthusiasts. Read the original story on CAR Magazine.
