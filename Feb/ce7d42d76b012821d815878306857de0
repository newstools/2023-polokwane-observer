POLOKWANE – The first Limpopo qualifier for South Africa Western Mounted Games (SAWMGA) and South African National Equestrian Schools Association (Sanesa) Limpopo took place on February 11 at Winnfield Stables. It was hosted by the Capricorn Western Club. It was a challenging day for horses and riders as the riding arenas were wet due to rain the previous night. In spite of the level 5 weather warnings of local flooding and disruptive rain, 110 riders registered to participate. SAWMG is one of the few sports where the entire family can take part. At competitions, riders meet up with old friends and new friends are made as more and more people become part of the rider family. Riders from across Limpopo participated including local riders from Oosskool, Pietersburg Laerskool, Hoërskool Pietersburg, Curro Heuwelkruin and riding clubs in the city. The energy was contagious on Saturday as family and friends of the riders encouraged them to do their best. With music playing, the smell of delicious food and a mini flea market where entrepreneurs can sell their goods, the day was filled with friendly competition.
