POLOKWANE – Flying about 11km from Savannah Mall, one might look down and think you’re looking at an alien crop circle. When you look again you will realise it is a labyrinth and can be found at Pan’s Breeze overnight accommodation in Dalmada.  For the Pattersons, a dream and a time span of five months turned into a reality. The idea for the labyrinth was co-conceived by the Pattersons and was created between September 2022 and January 2023 in collaboration with Lara-Jean Gardiner, family and friends. Rheta Patterson told the Polokwane Review-Observer that the labyrinth is 70m in diameter and its distance from entrance to the centre and back is 3.2km. “More than one person can use the labyrinth at a time, providing the tranquillity of the area is maintained as it is a good place for anyone looking to reconnect with themselves and nature. It can be walked and it takes about 30 minutes to reach the centre and about 30 minutes to walk back out again.”  Rheta said they were intrigued by the experience of a labyrinth as a place for contemplation as globally, they are utilised for promoting mindfulness, alleviating worries, restoring balance, stimulating imagination and facilitating meditation, introspection, self-awareness, and stress relief. “We encourage people to stick to the path so as not to disrupt the nesting sites of grass owls and other endemic bird life in the area. Additionally, cutting across the paths within the labyrinth will cause it to degrade.” For more information, contact Pan’s Breeze on 072 232 8145.
