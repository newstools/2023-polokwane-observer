POLOKWANE – The Building Bridges Gospel Tour concert was hosted on February 13 at Mitchell House featuring Gospel en Gironde from France with Soweto choir, PEPPS choir and Mitchell House junior and senior choirs. The Building Bridges Gospel Tour is meant to build alliances with schools and community choirs across South Africa, with France. The first tour took place in 2014 and this year was the third time the tour came to Mitchell House, this time with two choir leaders from France and Jimmy Mulovhedzi from the Soweto choir. One of the organisers, Nthabiseng Freychet-Cook, said the intention is to strengthen ties among friends in the country. “There is now a relationship between Mitchell House and Botshabelo Drop-in Centre, where they provide food, clothing, and school supplies. They are also fostering partnerships with the Soweto choir. This is interesting because now the communities will interact and mix with one another.” Building Bridges was motivated by a conversation Freychet-Cook had with her old friend from high school, Rob Lavis, who suggested that the French choir visit South Africa to experience the true rainbow nation. This year Gospel en Gironde collaborated with Soweto choir to make one big Building Bridges choir. In 2015 Mitchell House with Memeza Africa choir visited France. Building Bridges discovered other choirs such as Balatedi Ba Morena from Seshego. The gospel tour hopes to have more interactions with other choirs in Polokwane.
