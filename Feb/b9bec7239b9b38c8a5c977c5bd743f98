POLOKWANE – Judge Joseph Raulinga, presiding in the murder trial of Rameez Patel, last Thursday said the defence team would need to bring forward compelling arguments as to why it was necessary to bring more witnesses. Patel stands accused of murdering his wife, Fatima at their home in Nirvana on 2015.

He had granted a postponement in November last year, to February 8 and 9, as the standing witness called by Patel, Prof Terrence Kommal was not available until the National Prosecuting Authority closed for the festive season. Kommal insists based on evidence that Fatima died from strangulation and not a bullet proof allegedly fired by Patel, when the incident transpired.

A new trial date has been set for May 15 and 17.
