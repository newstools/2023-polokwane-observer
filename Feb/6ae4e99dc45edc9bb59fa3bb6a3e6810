If you’re looking for a quick and easy lunchbox snack that’s not only healthy but convenient too, why not slice up a few pieces of delicious mango? Kids love the sweet juicy taste; not only does it fill their tummies – it’s also a great thirst quencher for hot summer days. Mangoes are high in vitamins A, C, and biotin, and the mineral potassium. This yummy fruit is also a source of vitamins B1 and B6, and free from fat, sodium and cholesterol – so many more reasons to pack a mango in your children’s lunchboxes! Remember, fruit should always be eaten in portion-controlled amounts. A portion of sliced fresh mango that can fit into the palm of your child’s hand is the ideal serving size for school-going children. Although healthy eating is imperative, we all love that occasional indulgent treat – and our Mango Jam is just that – and is perfect for that school lunchbox sarmie!
