Last year was the “Work from Home” year, which saw a big focus on setting up trendy home offices and finding clever ways to create separate “work zones” in your open-plan home. This year is all about making energy and water improvements, installing dreamy bathrooms and fab outdoor entertainment spaces. Be it a little DIY project to give a space a facelift or a fully fledged floor-to-ceiling room renovation – whatever your budget and DIY skills can manage, we’ve got the lowdown on the hottest home improvement trends from Kandua for 2023 to get you started.  Loadshedding is here to stay, which puts solar panels and boreholes on the top of every homeowner’s wish list. Be careful when choosing a solar panel supplier and make sure they have reliable references and trustworthy reviews. Look for a system that will generate a reliable electricity supply for 25 years plus. While initial installation costs are high, you should recoup them in just a few years, and having an alternative power option is a major bonus when selling your home.  Think spa vibes for your bathroom…a big, round bathtub or walk-in shower introduces an element of luxury, while a calming, soothing décor colour scheme promotes relaxation. It needs to be a wellness space, which will not only boost your home’s value, but also your overall wellbeing, as it will be a space to breathe, and just be after a stressful day. Big bathroom trends for 2023 include statement tiles throughout and heated floors that will recreate that luxurious spa experience.  Living in SA means we can really take outdoor living to the max. Think outdoor kitchens, stylish seating areas and firepits –  it needs to be both aesthetically pleasing and provide practical benefits.
