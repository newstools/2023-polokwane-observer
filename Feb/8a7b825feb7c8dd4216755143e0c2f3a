More than 100 000 people voted the Alfa Romeo Giulia the winner in the midsize import category of the Best Cars 2023 competition managed by Auto Motor und Sport magazine. Another Italian, the new Alfa Romeo Tonale, missed victory in the compact SUV category by a mere 0.2%. The Stelvio finished in the top three in the large SUV importers category. Auto Motor und Sport conducted this competition for the 47th time. It featured 422 vehicles in 13 categories. Niccolò Biagioli, Alfa’s brand director in Germany, said, “I would like to thank the readers of Auto Motor und Sport from the bottom of my heart for their enthusiasm for the Alfa Romeo Giulia, which they have once again voted among the winners. This renewed success is testimony to the great trust placed in Alfa Romeo and is an incentive for us to continue the transformation of our brand, currently under way, with high ambition.” Source: QuickPic
