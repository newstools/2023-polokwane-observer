Confit of duck with clementines is a classic French dish that is both rich and flavourful. It involves cooking duck legs in their own fat until they are tender and falling off the bone, and then serving them with a sauce made from clementines and other ingredients like red wine and chicken stock. The clementines add a bright and refreshing citrus note to the dish, which pairs perfectly with the rich and savoury flavour of the duck. This dish by Instantpot is typically served over a bed of rice or mashed potatoes, and is the perfect indulgent meal for a special occasion or night in. Serves 4
