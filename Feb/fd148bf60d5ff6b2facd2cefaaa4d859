POLOKWANE – The Moolman group of companies has confirmed that the canopy roof which had fallen without prior notice in the Central Business District has been fixed. Street vendors in Rissik Street near Kerk Street feared that an unsealed, already dilapidated canopy roofing which shelters their stalls, was a cause for harm. Corrugated iron sealing the canopy on one portion, plunged without notice recently, resulting in minor injuries and some stalls destroyed along with the products they sell. The building belongs to one of the companies under the group, as confirmed by Asset Manager, Peter Prett. Some of those who escaped without injuries told Polokwane Observer that the already leaking roof top did not show signs of flaking or that it would plunge at an earliest time. Fortunately the ailing infrastructure did not suffer any noticeable effects where retail shops, a pharmacy and a popular fast food outlet are based. On the day, heavy thunderstorms and winds were experienced, which according to the victims, contributed to the event which occurred in the late afternoon at around 15:00. Emergency medical services personnel arrived at the scene to assist followed by police to assess the situation. One of the victims whose scalp had been cut open by the corrugated iron spent a day in hospital and had to receive stitches. Another victim said it was clear that the building needed to be maintained.
