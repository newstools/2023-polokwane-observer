Did you know the average school bag should weigh between 10% and 15% of a child’s body weight? This means that a child weighing 22 kilograms should not be carrying a bag that weighs more than 3 kilograms. However, many students carry bags that weigh much more than this, with some bags weighing up to 20% of a child’s body weight. This excess weight can lead to a range of health problems, including: Carrying a heavy school bag can cause strain on the muscles and spine, leading to back pain. This can cause discomfort and limit a child’s ability to participate in physical activities. Shoulder straps that are too narrow can dig into a child’s shoulders, causing pain and discomfort. The bag’s weight can also pull the shoulders down, leading to strain on the neck and upper back. Heavy bags can cause strain on the neck, leading to pain and discomfort. This can also lead to headaches, making it difficult for children to focus in class. Carrying a heavy school bag can also lead to poor posture, which can cause long-term health problems, including spinal alignment issues and chronic back pain. It’s important for parents to take action to prevent these health problems. Here are some steps you can take: Check the weight of your child’s bag: Regularly check the weight of your child’s bag to ensure it does not exceed 10-15% of their body weight. Use a backpack with wide straps: Wide straps help distribute the weight of the bag evenly, reducing the strain on the shoulders and neck. Adjust the straps: Adjust the straps of the bag to ensure they are not too tight or too loose. The straps should be tight enough to keep the bag close to the back but not so tight that they dig into the shoulders. Use both straps: Encourage your child to use both straps of the bag to distribute the weight evenly. Using only one strap can cause strain on one side of the body. Lighten the load: Encourage your child to only carry the essentials, leaving out heavy items that are not necessary. This can help reduce the bag’s weight, making it easier for them to carry. Schools can also play a role in preventing heavy school bags and the health problems that come with them. Here are some steps schools can take: Provide lockers: Lockers can be used to store textbooks and other heavy items, reducing the weight of the bag. Encourage digital textbooks: Encouraging the use of digital textbooks can help reduce the weight of the bag, as students can carry a tablet or laptop instead of heavy textbooks. Educate students: Schools can educate students about the dangers of heavy school bags and encourage them to take steps to prevent health problems. Provide ergonomic bags: Schools can provide ergonomic bags with wide straps and other features to help reduce the strain on the back, neck, and shoulders.
