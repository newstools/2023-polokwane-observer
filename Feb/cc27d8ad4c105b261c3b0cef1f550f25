One of the suspects grabbed the younger victim and pulled her into the nearby bushes and raped her,” his statement read. The rape victim managed to free herself and called for help. “A vehicle with five occupants stopped next to her and she was explaining what had happened when the same suspects accosted them. They brutally hacked one of the men with a sharp object and he died at the scene. Another occupant was stabbed and seriously injured,” Mojapelo said.
