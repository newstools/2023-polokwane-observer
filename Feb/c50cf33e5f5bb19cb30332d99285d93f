The digital media space is very dynamic. It’s therefore not surprising that the industry standard for over 60 years has evolved in line with the ever-adapting South African automotive market. In order to respond to the changing dynamics, CAR magazine has launched a listing component in a website update. The updated website is set to  deliver the latest automotive-related news from the local and global automotive industry, while in-depth reviews and launch experiences continue to feature strongly.  However, it will now also include a comprehensive listing of more than 1200 passenger vehicles on sale in the local market. Car’s editorial authority informs your purchase decision, in line with the website’s “Know the car. Buy the car.” mantra.  Furthermore, a diverse spread of dealerships offering personalised profiles populated with inventory and navigation to service and spare parts centres, as well as workshops, amplify a prospective buyer’s experience. Ryan Vrede, Head of Motoring and Travel at the iconic title’s publishers, Habari Media, says ; “The refreshed website retains the familiarity of South Africa’s authoritative automotive source but with a more modern flavour, and an even greater emphasis on news and vehicles for sale. This unequivocally benefits end-users utilising the platform and empowers them with relevant news about a potential vehicle purchase.”
