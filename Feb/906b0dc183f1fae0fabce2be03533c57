With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, have you wondered how the connection between love and chocolates was made and how the tradition of giving chocolates on Valentine’s Day was formed? While the history of Valentine’s Day stretches back to the Roman era, the addition of chocolate as the staple fixture for the day dedicated to the celebration of love is more recent. It was in the mid-1800s that Richard Cadbury was looking for a way to utilise cocoa butter extracted during the making of chocolate liquor and came up with the humble chocolate bar. Previously, chocolate was an expensive item that only the wealthy were able to buy, but Cadbury was able to produce chocolate that was affordable to all. His next step was to create beautiful boxes – decorated with cupids and roses – to entice buyers, and it was these that became the must-have Valentine’s Day gift of the day. Besides the great taste and texture and the attractive wrappings, there are other reasons why chocolate is linked with Valentine’s Day. What better way then to delight your sweetheart this Valentine’s Day than with more than a box of chocolates, but rather a chocolate creation made by you to show just how much you really care! With that in mind, here are five chocolate-themed recipes – suggested by chefs from Capsicum Culinary Studio – that are guaranteed to impress your loved one. Ganache For the ganache: Place chocolate and cream in a saucepan over low heat and stir until melted. Spoon over tarts. Once cooled top with fresh raspberries.  *Chef’s Notes: This flourless cake goes well with vanilla ice cream, peanut brittle and caramelised banana, or Chantilly cream with a berry compote.
