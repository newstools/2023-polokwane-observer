Chery has made serious inroads into the hearts of South African customers and soon SA will be able to enjoy the thrills of the newest, and safest, of Chery’s SUVs. The Omoda C5 is the first Chery to achieve the esteemed Euro NCAP safety results, and obtain five stars. It is important to note that many other Chery vehicles have achieved five stars in Chinese NCAP tests. “The Omoda C5’s crash-test performance is significant in many respects,” says Tony Liu, the executive deputy general manager of Chery South Africa. “For one, it is a firm endorsement of our brand’s commitment to vehicle safety and the safety and security of its passengers. For another, it offers independent validation of the quality of engineering and manufacturing of Chery vehicles. After all, safety starts with the car design and is directly dependent on build quality.”  The Omoda’s safety cell can withstand pressures of over 1 800Mpa, which means it will stay intact during front and side crashes. The Euro NCAP report scored the Omoda 87% for the protection of adult occupants, and the same score for the protection of child passengers. It also gave it a score of 88% for the quality and efficacy of its safety-assistance systems. “For Chery, safety is non-negotiable. This means that all our models, from the Tiggo 4 Pro to the upcoming Omoda C5, offer a very high level of safety features as standard and why families can safely trust their Chery to keep them safe around town and on longer trips,” says Liu.
