POLOKWANE – Chairperson of Limpopo Softball Association, Mokgadi Mswazwi said they are proud of the achievements of the junior and senior team in the 2022 softball season.

Mswazwi said the aim is to make sure that all the teams in the association win all the tournaments and championships this year. “All the teams won major championships last year and we are hoping to bring more silverware to the clubs this year. The senior men have been doing well in the past years and we would love to see the senior female team win.” She attributed the success to the structures and plans the association has implemented in the past decades. “We are well organised association. We take care of our players and we give them the necessary support. We have good coaches and they dedicate their time to guide the players. To our senior women’s team, we are saying, don’t lose hope, you must continue to work hard and your time to win the championship will come.” She wished the senior men’s team well in their National Provincial Championship which will be hosted on March 19-20 in KwaZulu-Natal. “We will also have players in the senior national team that will represent the country at the African Qualifiers in Botswana.
