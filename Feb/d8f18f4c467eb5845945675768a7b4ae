POLOKWANE – The South African Weather Service has placed Polokwane under a level 5 warning for disruptive rain.  The warning has been in effect from 05:46 this morning and will continue until 21:59 tonight with medium likelihood and significant impact expected. The warning comes amid a cut-off low-pressure system sweeping across the Eastern half of the country, bringing with it heavy rain and thunderstorms. Earlier this week, the weather service said the system would be quasi-stationary from Thursday (February 9) until today, before dissipating on Sunday (February 12). The weather service says a Level 5 warning could bring the following: “If possible stay indoors and off the roads, avoid crossing rivers and swollen streams where water is above your ankles. If trapped in a vehicle during a flood, abandon it and climb to higher ground. In buildings, move valuables to a safe place above the expected flood level,” the website reads. The weather service has also warned not to seek shelter under trees or tall objects and to not go fishing or play golf as both golf clubs and fishing rods are a good conductors of electricity. AccuWeather has forecast a 96% chance of thunderstorms today and more rain is expected moving into next week.
