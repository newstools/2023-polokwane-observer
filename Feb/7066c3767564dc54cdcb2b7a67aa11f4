The Seaward Shiraz is an elegant accompaniment to an informal – yet delicious – grazing board of cold cuts, mezze bites and fresh, crunchy artisanal bread. The marinated vegetables can be made a day or two ahead and make fantastic toppings for crostinis (toasted pieces of bread, served as appetisers). (serves 4) Spier Seaward wines’ style and complexity have been strongly influenced by their coastal terroir. The Atlantic’s cooling breezes allow the vines to thrive in optimal conditions for gradual ripening. Minimal intervention is needed to produce a crop of outstanding quality, year after year. After careful crafting by our winemakers, the result is a Shiraz which has great concentration, balance and finesse. Tall, dark and handsome, the Spier Seaward Shiraz offers an intense mix of mulberry, violets and pepper flavours; 14 months of maturing in wood gives it suavely smooth tannins. Spier Seaward wines can be tasted and purchased at the farm in Stellenbosch and online at shop.spier.co.za.
