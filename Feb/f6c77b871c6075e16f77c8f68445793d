The Hispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne, although probably not known to the average Joe, has proved the company’s ability to combine performance, technology and magnificent design to produce one-of-a-kind super cars. Hispano Suiza is a historic Spanish automotive brand owned by the Suqué Mateu family, now in its fourth generation. Their cars are designed by experts well versed with the dynamics and demands of Formula 1 cars. The result is a vehicle delivering 1 114CV (constant voltage) of power in the Carmen Boulogne, and 1 019 CV in the Carmen, with a fully electric engine, and with a driving range of 400km on a full charge in zero-emission mode. All this is courtesy of the 80kWh battery with which it is fitted.  With 829kW on tap and a curb weight of only 1 690kg, both the Carmen and Carmen Boulogne will do 0- 100km/h in a blistering three seconds. The 1930 H6C Dubonnet Xenia inspired the design of the Carmen. The interior represents opulence and superb quality, and best of all, no two Hispano Suizas are the same. Suiza clients can choose from 1 904 combinations to configure their individual cars. Now, with the production of the Hispano Suiza Carmen and Carmen Boulogne limited to 24 units only, this represents super car exclusivity par excellence. Source: Newspress
