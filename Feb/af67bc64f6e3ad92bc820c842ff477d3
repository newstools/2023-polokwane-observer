POLOKWANE – The Municipality says their electrical maintenance team is attending to multiple electrical faults on the 11kv supply cable in the Ladanna area. Municipal communications manager Matshidiso Mothapo said the residential area has been hit the hardest by these faults. “Technicians are searching for the faults and electricity is likely to be off for a while,” his statement read. Mothapo said time frames cannot be provided at this point due to multiple faults and that feedback will be provided once received. “The team will do their best to restore electricity as soon as possible and all affected consumers are requested to exercise patience while the faults are being attended to. We advise affected areas to treat all wiring as live during the outage and to switch off all appliances to avoid injury and damage when supply is restored,” he added.
