POLOKWANE – Horse organ smugglers are targeting Polokwane and owners are urged to be vigilant. The owners of a horse-riding academy in the city are still coming to terms with the deaths of two of their horses, owing to organ smugglers. On January 22, members of the academy discovered the horses in a nearby field along the Percy Fyfe road in the Westenburg policing area, with their ears, tails and eyes, among other body organs, having been removed.  The horses had been missing from the previous morning. A member of the school, whose identity is withheld for safety reasons, explained: “We saw one the horses on Friday, but not on Saturday and went looking for it on Sunday. We found the horse with the body slit open from the back, the organs and genitals removed, and we alerted the SPCA.”  The SPCA, who only deal with securing live animals, advised that a criminal matter be reported to the police. On Sunday, a second horse was discovered dead in an open field, with a sharp metal arrow pierced to its neck. No organs had, however, been removed. In this case, the matter was reported to the local CPF, with a request for regular patrols. No cases had, however, been reported to the police. A member of the Limpopo Community Policing Forum under the Polokwane police station, Valerie Maloba strongly advised that an official case be opened for a thorough investigation to be done. “Nobody knows who saw what and which evidence could be available. They must not overlook this matter.” Meanwhile, Limpopo police spokesperson Col Malesela Ledwaba said they would only comment on the matter once it has been brought to their attention officially through the opening of a case. The academy member has recommended that animal owners ensure additional security measures to avoid similar incidents.
