POLOKWANE – With an aim to raise funds to buy the media club new equipment, Taxila learners together with coordinator Regina Magolo hosted a successful 5km fun run and walk this past Saturday (February 18). The hosts invited the Nirvana community, teachers, learners and parents for a day of fun-filled activities to help the media club buy cameras, microphones, tripods and other equipment needed. Magolo said the event also gave participants a chance to refresh from their week-long duties at work and at school. “Weekends are the perfect time to unwind and relax and we thought we’d start off with a workout and end the event with fun games that would accommodate kids and adults,” she said. Supporters gave their all as they ran the demarcated route which started at the school, ran through Nirvana and ended back at the school. Participants were given gold medals upon completion of the 5km course and aerobics, colour stations and games were set up to continue the fun.
