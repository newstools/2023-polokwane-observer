POLOKWANE – Mamedupi Teffo is among the youngest female mayors in South Africa, heading up the Capricorn District Municipality. As in the 1980s, what was regarded as normal living conditions in the Ga-Ramongwana homelands, the 42-year-old lived with her many family members, including her only sister and mother. She became her great grandfather’s confidante, running errands, given his ailing health. This journey shaped her leadership traits, she says. “I bought groceries because my mother was working for Mike’s Kitchen and did not have free time. He shared his financial difficulties with me, which I fought to overcome. I even assumed similar responsibilities even in the community,” she says. The girls later moved with their mother, to Ga-Semenya in 2001. Teffo went on to study a diploma in information technology but failed to finish after falling pregnant and subsequent financial constraints at the age of 21. In 2006, Teffo again enrolled, studying a BA degree in health sciences and social services, and it is in this time that she joined politics. “The South African Students Congress became my home. My poverty was well hidden – I was fed and transported. Before I knew it, I was elected as an SRC member until I graduated,” she tells Polokwane Observer. Things turned around for her when, a few weeks after graduating in 2011, the ANC called on youths to apply to serve in various municipal councils. “The term ‘generational mix’ had just been coined. At 26, I served as a member of the mayoral committee. I could take care of my family financially and grew mentally to suit the environment when I became chief whip,” she mentions. She served in this capacity until she was elected as CDM mayor. The mother of two says her biggest challenge in serving the people, is a shortage of resources. “There is only so much I can do from the budget we are allocated. My wish, however, is to have enough resources to service everyone.”
