There is just no denying it, some cars, once you have driven or owned them, bond with your heart and soul like tyres to a track. One such car is the Porsche 911. It was launched 60 years ago and ever since, was recognised as an icon. Timeless design has staying power. And today’s 911s look much like the original model designed by the legendary Ferdinand Porsche. Beautifully proportioned and exceedingly fast, the iconic supercar continues to captivate the hearts of local sports car enthusiasts. According to AutoTrader data, R1 901 060 typically buys a 2010-registered Porsche 911 with an average of 47 462km on the clock. Romance with the Ford Mustang, a quintessential American muscle car, was rekindled when this powerful pony car returned to its styling roots. Reborn as a wider and lower interpretation of the original 1964 Mustang, the modern Mustang retains original DNA elements and recognisable styling cues like its unique muscular two-door coupé stance and distinctive tribar tail-lights. According to AutoTrader, R864 992 bags a 2016 model with an average mileage of just 28 549km. A palatable R204 708 is what love bug devotees can expect to pay for a 1999-registered VW Beetle with mileage averaging 109 975km. The love of the humble and quirky little buglike car has not faded over the years. Also designed by Ferdinand Porsche, this small, affordable, low-maintenance and fun-loving two-door VW Beetle has captivated hearts since 1945. Dubbed the people’s car, the round design of the cute classic Beetle remained largely unchanged over its many decades of production. Passion for the Beetle transferred to its successor, the VW Golf. Round became square, although, over eight generations of production, the boxy compact hatchback has become a tad more curved. Since its local introduction in 1978, performance-obsessed South Africans have been hooked on this handsome nippy hatch. On average, a 2016 model with mileage around 95 646km, lists for R389 468. Generations of South Africans have championed the Toyota Corolla, holding on to their Corollas for far longer than average, which is unsurprising given the sedan’s spaciousness, reliability, durability and competitive pricing. Today, a 2016 model with mileage of 86 832 lists on AutoTrader for an average of R262 653. When a car fits one’s personality, needs, and wallet, the emotional connection to that car is not easily broken.
