POLOKWANE – Noordelikes Rugby Club has strengthened their technical team by appointing Hendrik van Jaarsveld and AK Adams in January. Hendrik will assist Arno Hannekom who took over the head coach position last year. Adams from Westenburg Rugby Club will be in charge of the third team. Tony de Costa, chairperson of Noordelikes Rugby Club said the three coaches bring a wealth of experience in coaching and will help the club to achieve their goals. “We are happy to have them in the team. They have done well in the respective teams and we believe they will bring the same success in their new teams. We will be playing friendly matches in March against Letaba, Potties, NkowaNkowa and Louis Trichardt. The friendly matches will be a build-up to the league matches that will start in April,” de Costa said. Hendrik said their aim is to put Noordelikes back on the map because for a very long time it has been getting a lot of militancy publicly. “We are a good club. I will implore an aggressive style in the rugs, defense and line-ups. Rugby is a different sport, we play with an oval shaped ball and it can take any direction but we stand a chance of winning the league.”
