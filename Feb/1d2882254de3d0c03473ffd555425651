POLOKWANE – Dora Gertrude Buys, affectionately known as Mama D, believes that the fear of judgement is what holds people back from doing what’s best for them. Mama D is a mother figure in the Westenburg community and apart from her bold personality and motherly demeanor, she is also an advocate for the elderly. Mama D is a breast cancer survivor and is vocal about her recovery journey. In 2018, she felt like she was bitten by a mosquito on her right breast and she could feel the lump growing. “I decided to go to the doctor was referred to a radiologist who did a mammogram and other tests which confirmed it was breast cancer,” she said. Part of her recovery process was making the decision to have her breast removed to lower the chance of recurrence. Mama D said that she has no regrets about having her breast removed because it saved her life and she wouldn’t hesitate to do it again. “People might think that I was worried about the looks I would get having only one breast but it is the fear of judgement that holds us back from living our lives. As humans, we’re afraid to face challenges that come our way but remember, if you believe that there is a living God who will carry us through that dark tunnel, then there’s nothing to be afraid of,” she said. Mama D has assisted other women in the community who have gotten sick and said that is how the circle of support begins. “Cancer is not something to be ashamed about and people’s stories can motivate someone else to not lose hope. It’s also okay to make jokes and laugh about it. I make jokes at our club and I do this so that people are not afraid to talk about cancer or any other illness that may cause depression or anxiety, that way they feel free to talk about anything and not hold back,” she said.
