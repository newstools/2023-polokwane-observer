POLOKWANE – Dimakatso Crèche and Preschool in Seshego Zone 1 is the second preschool to have experienced a break-in since the beginning of the year. Good Hope Pre-school in Zone 5 met the same fate weeks prior. Last Sunday, thieves gained access to Dimakatso’s kitchen, making off with two 48kg gas cylinders with a combined estimated value of R3 500, as well as uncooked food. The perpetrators entered and exited through the roof. Evidence left behind has given the community hope that the thieves will be caught. “Based on the evidence we have already found, we are confident that we will find them with the help of the police. A suspect has already been found and connected to the theft at Good Hope Preschool,” a source close to BONUS says. Although a criminal case has been opened, according to the property owner, local police are yet to confirm if any progress has been made. Seshego Community Against Crime and Gangsterism (Scacag) member, Vincent Kunutu says buying isolated items at questionable prices are cause for concern because they create a thriving market for stolen goods. He advises that whoever finds suspicion in an isolated sale, especially of related items, should get into contact with the police or phone him on 082 063 8272.
