Chery’s visibility and its value-for-money products are attracting a lot of attention. Its sales numbers are proof that the brand has won the hearts of South African buyers. The increase in demand for Chery SUVs has motivated it to open a fleet division to service the rental market. The fleet sales division will be headed by Lazola Qungwana, an automotive specialist with over 15 years of experience in fleet sales and customer support. Qungwana joins Chery from Stellantis, where he looked after regional sales for the company. He is also an alumnus of Jaguar Land Rover, Volkswagen and Audi. “I’m excited to join such a fast-growing vehicle brand and to assist corporate and fleet buyers with their purchases, financing and service requirements,” says Qungwana. “Fleet purchases are a strong endorsement of any brand’s quality and service, as large fleet buyers have very strict requirements for durability, reliability and 24/7 customer service.” “It is worth noting that Chery’s sales success to date is almost exclusively thanks to individual customers. Private customers actively sought out the brand, bought our Tiggo Pro range and shared their positive experiences with friends and family,” says Tony Liu, the executive deputy general manager of Chery South Africa. Liu says Chery’s success and its market-leading mechanical warranty have drawn the attention of fleet customers, who have been in contact with Chery South Africa and its dealer network to buy vehicles in larger quantities. “The Chery fleet sales division has always been on our South African strategic plan, but we have decided to expedite its formation to meet this demand from buyers,” says JayJay Botes, the national sales manager of Chery South Africa.
