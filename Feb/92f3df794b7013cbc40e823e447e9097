POLOKWANE – Chef Lethabo Matshabe is affectionately known as the hippie chef. Matshabe who initially wanted to become an economist had a change of heart when he realised he was not very good at mathematics. It was at this time that he reverted back to his love for cooking. Matshabe is a private chef with experience in the restaurant and fast food industry. He is known as the hippie chef as a result of his love for exploring his culinary skills making use of cannabidiol (CBD), an active ingredient in cannabis that does not cause a high and is not addictive and is legal to use.

It has been a tough road to gain recognition for his craft, however, his passion sustains him. He shared that his current long-term goal is to one day open a restaurant serving CBD infused meals. “It is a work in progress. Its just that it requires capital to get the CBD and all the equipment that is required to make it a success,” he said. A tough lesson that he has learned in the industry is that people can be full of empty promises. “I have worked at catering gigs that did not end up paying what was agreed. I have learned a lot in the past few years and the industry is a dog-eat-dog,” he said. The young chef, however, is enjoying the industry that he has chosen to be part of and looks forward to establishing himself as one of the most sort after chefs in the world. He will soon launch his business Otaku Base Camp which is set to make waves.
