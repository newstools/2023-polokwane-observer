The Northern Region Rotax Max Challenge took place in sweltering heat with three different winners in the DD2 class heats. Kian Grottis was excluded on a technicality, handing the opening premier direct drive gearbox class race win to Nicolaos Vostanis. Wayland Wyman took race 2 as Grottis fought from the back to second before Grottis took the final. Wyman took the day in DD2. Masters’ pair, Kyle Lawrence and Llewellyn Sutherland, and Grottis rounded off the top six. In the open Senior Max KC Ensor-Smith came, saw, and conquered. He won his first two races but was sidelined in the third race which was won by Olerato Sekudu. The Junior Max class produced its share of drama too. Wian Boshoff overcame a startline infringement that deprived him of his race 2 win, to take the final and the day on a count-back over second race winner Kent Swartz. In the U13 Mini Max, Caleb Odendaal picked up where he left off to romp to a triple win. U11 Micro Max was won by SA champion, Rafael Da Silva. Luhan de Wet beat Adriaan Steyn two races to one to take the Baby Bambino day. The next event in the series will be hosted at Killarney in Cape Town.
