POLOKWANE – The police in Mokopane have arrested two suspects believed to be accomplices in filling station robberies in the province during an intelligence driven joint operation last week. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said one of the suspects (32) was arrested at his residential place in Mookgophong where police confiscated coins, packets of cigarettes, registration number plates, two voucher machines and uniform belonging to the G4S security company. “The second suspect (28) was arrested in Ga-Magongwa village under the Mokopane policing precinct and he was found in possession of five packets of Stuyvesant menthol cigarettes,” his statement read. Mojapelo said preliminary police investigations positively linked the suspects to six cases of business robbery committed at filling stations in Polokwane, Mokopane, Mookgophong and Gilead between December 2022 and January 2023. The two men will appear before the Mokopane Magistrate’s Court today (February 6) on eight counts of business robbery and possession of suspected stolen properties. “A manhunt for the remaining suspects is underway. Anyone with information that can lead to their apprehension should contact Detective Sergeant Makwela on 076 786 1447, the toll-free crime stop number 08600 10111, the nearest police station or the MySAPSApp,” Mojapelo said.
