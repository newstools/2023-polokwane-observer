LIMPOPO – Seven people were killed in a collision on the D1399 Loskop road near the Maranata Lodge in the Sekhukhune district on Sunday afternoon (February 26). The Department of Transport says the collision is said to have happened when a hatchback t-boned another vehicle causing both to lose control, overturn and catch on fire. “Seven people including the drivers of the two vehicles were burnt beyond recognition. The only survivor was transported to a nearby health facility with serious injuries,” departmental spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene said. She added that law enforcement officers at the scene cited reckless driving as a possible cause of the collision. Transport and Community Safety MEC Florence Radzilani said the loss of lives on Limpopo’s roads due to reckless behaviour by motorists is a cause for concern. “We urge drivers to be mindful of their actions at all times and for all to arrive alive at their respective destinations,” she said.
