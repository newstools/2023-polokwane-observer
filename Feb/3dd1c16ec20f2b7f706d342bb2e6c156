It looks like boozier isn’t always better as people all over the world are choosing low and no-alcohol drinks. Low-ABV is the buzzword of 2022 as health-conscious Millennials and Gen Zers are turning to alcohol-free sips to quench their thirst, and with more consumers focusing on their health and moderation, the low-ABV movement has been picking up speed. But it’s not just about abstaining from alcohol. It’s about enjoying time with friends and savouring the flavours of adult beverages without the hangover. It’s why sports lovers and players have chosen the ANGOSTURA® Rock Shandy as their go-to drink since the early days of its conception. The ultimate summer refreshment after a rough time on the greens or a day spent tossing a ball on the pitch, you can find this iconic South African drink at the best bars, restaurants, and clubhouses around the country. And it can be made in mere minutes at home. Simply line up your ingredients, tackle the lemonade with a soda water and drop dashes of ANGOSTURA® Aromatic bitters – because it’s not a true Angostura Rock Shandy if it doesn’t contain a few healthy dashes from the can’t-miss bottle with its oversized label and distinct yellow cap. Now scrum! You can score an easy touchdown with your friends and family at your next braai by whipping up a party-size jug with the Lazy Rock Shandy. Top tip: If you remove the drop-top on the bottle you can add 2-4 tablespoons – easier on the arms! And now that the drinks are sorted, you just need the right sweet and salty snack to accompany it while you wait for the fire to cool down. These Angostura bitter-glazed nuts will check all the boxes. (Makes three cups)
