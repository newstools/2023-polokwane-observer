POLOKWANE – Phuti Ralephenya says he has always known that he wants to become a doctor. Ralephenya was Myngenoegen English Private School’s overall top achiever in 2022 and says his career choice influenced his subject choice. As a high achiever, Ralephenya said he had to put the hard work in and had to overcome challenges such as load-shedding and lack of sleep along the way. “I was not as stable during the year as I could have been because I didn’t realise the magnitude of what was coming my way, but I caught a big breakthrough halfway that had me putting in more effort.” Ralephenya is among the top matric achievers in the Capricorn South District who made it to the top 100 during preliminary exams and passed all his subjects with 75% upwards with an average of 76.7%. He advised Gr 12 learners to have an ‘I can do’ attitude and deny a social life as much as possible. “Do not overwork yourself but don’t go to sleep until you are satisfied with what you have done for the day or night.” Ralephenya is currently pursuing his career in dental surgery at Wits University and he says he would like to extend gratitude to his life science, geography and mathematics teachers as well as MEPS management and the principal, Sandy Pitsi.
