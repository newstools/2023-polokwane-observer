Bringing the almost-forgotten smoky style of Irish whiskey back into the consciousness and repertoire of discerning premium spirits drinkers is the collection of Silkie whiskeys. Each whiskey in the collection is blended to an exacting standard by Sliabh Liag Distillers and takes drinkers on a journey through the rich, surprising rewards of whiskies with a varying degree of smoky character. Sliabh Liag Distillers founder, James Doherty’s childhood holidays in Donegal nurtured a love for the folk tales of the Sliabh Liag peninsula and more importantly a dream for the future possibilities of reclaiming Donegal’s distilling heritage; this is the driving passion behind James and Moira Doherty’s return to Donegal to establish Sliabh Liag Distillers. The Silkie whiskey range is named after the mermaids who would come ashore, shedding their sea-like coat to become beautiful dark-haired maidens and steal the hearts of local fishermen, and is the first product launched by the business.
