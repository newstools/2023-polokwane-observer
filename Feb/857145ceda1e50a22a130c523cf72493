POLOKWANE – The principal of Pietersburg Comprehensive School (PCS), Rudi Fick believes he still has more years to offer the teaching profession. Fick started teaching at PCS in 1994 and was appointed as the principal of the school in 2015 following the departure of Denise Classen. The 58-year-old dad of two says he does not contemplate retirement any time soon. “I enjoy what I do. I have a passion for education, I teach mathematics occasionally and I love helping learners with mathematics papers and exercises.” He says he finds fulfillment in leading more that 1 200 learners and their teachers everyday. “We are one big family and we support each another.” Fick highlights the role of encouragement and support in shaping a school to what it can become. “We support learners and teachers with everything they need and we always plead with our parents to ensure that they give the necessary support to their children, in order for them to excel in everything they do. I am a proud principal of an amazing school.” Part of this pride is the school’s achievements. The school has produced public figures and reality stars including as Bokang Montjane, Miss South 2010 and Miss World Africa in 2011 and Eric Macheru, popularly known as Leeto in Skeem Saam. “Both of them are the products of the school and they are also others who are doing well in the various disciplines. We are also doing well in extramural activities. We have the drummies, soccer and chess teams that have excelled in most of their competitions over the years. We want to produce even more leaders and winners at the school and continue building the legacy of this successful school for future generations.” He says his teaching highlight was being promoted to this position and excelling with aplomb. “It has been almost 10 years now. I could not have done this without the support of my family, teachers, parents, school governing body and my wife,” he remarked.
