POLOKWANE – Seshego residents recently destroyed a scrap metal business owned by a foreign national at his facility in Zone 5, which they believe is responsible for the towering cable theft in the area. In recent weeks, a significant number of electrical wires have been removed in Seshego. On February 1, a group went to see the foreign national owner at his business, where corrugated iron was stocked, to verify whether or not he has a valid licence of operation and to inform him of their concerns relating to cable theft.  Based on information provided by the police, any person intending to apply for registration as a recycler in terms of Section 25 of the Act, must obtain the relevant application forms from the office of the designated police office. The Somali business owner presented a valid licence, as issued by the Seshego Police Station. Residents went ahead, causing damage to the property and insist on a follow-up meeting with the police to discuss reasons for closing down the business.  “Criminals are using that scrap metal to enrich themselves with our township’s resources. What more must happen to show that despite this man having a valid licence, we suffer, and the state suffers resources because of it?” a concerned community member asked. Some residents said the possibility also exists for the owner to relocate the business. An effort to trace the owner of the scrap metal for comment by BONUS has not yielded any fruit.
