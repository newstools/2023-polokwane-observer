Butter chicken is a must-try for anyone who loves Indian cuisine. The creamy tomato sauce, seasoned with a blend of aromatic spices, is absolutely heavenly. And the tender chicken pieces are cooked to perfection, making this dish a true delight for the taste buds. But the best part about butter chicken is that it’s so easy to make at home. Simply marinate the chicken in a mixture of yoghurt and spices, and then cook it in a rich and creamy tomato sauce in an air fryer. Serve it over a bed of fragrant basmati rice or with a side of warm naan bread, and you have a restaurant-quality meal that’s sure to impress. Recipe by Instant Pot.
