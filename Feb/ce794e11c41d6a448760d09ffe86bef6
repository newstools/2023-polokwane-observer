POLOKWANE – Some Chiefs soccer enthusiasts are still in despair as the glamour boys left them with very little glamour at Peter Mokaba Sport Complex on Sunday, when Golden Arrows took a 3-2 win. The loss can be blamed on poor defence by Kaizer Chiefs given the lack of stability in the backline since the start of the season, conceding silly goals.

This jinxes the synergy required to create a strong defence. The stadium filled almost to the rafters with thousands of soccer fans, mostly Chiefs fans, dominating the crowd. During the first half, Abafana beSthende were kept at bay by Chiefs’ strong midfield seeing their first goal bulge the net in the first eight minutes of the game scored by Sifiso Hlanti. The next score for Chiefs came from Mduduzi Shabalala 47 minutes into the game. But in the second half, Arrows came back with a vengeance and showed character when Knox Mutizwa and Ntsako Makhubela scored, creating a levelled but tense score. The final score declaring Arrows the winner came unexpectedly in the 69th minute from the boot of Mutizwa. Golden Arrows needed a stronger opponent in Chiefs in order to get their mojo back. They have in the past lost five games in a row, ahead of this significant dethrone over the weekend. The loss to Arrows became the talk of the town and left a bitter taste for the Phefeni boys supporters, who on their way back home questioned Chiefs’ coach Arthur Zwane’s team selection. “In the last four games, we have a single win, a draw and two losses. That is too much to bear. Clearly Zwane does not know these boys’ strengths and weaknesses. He must make way for other capable coaches,” said agitated Elliot Meko, a local Kaizer Chiefs supporter.
