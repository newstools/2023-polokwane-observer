Despite the economic crunch, travel is on the rise worldwide with flight passenger numbers expected to surpass the four billion mark this year – a first since 2019, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). With more direct international flight options available all the time, international travel is becoming more and more accessible and easy for South African holiday makers to enjoy, allowing them to join the 2023 trend to head overseas and tick off their bucket list destinations. We’ve got three reasons from Travelwings.com on why this should be the year to make your travel dreams come true:  •  You only live once – make it count The last two years made international travel almost impossible and crushed many people’s dreams of visiting their family overseas or going on that big adventure. Now, a post-Covid world will hopefully see the end of flight cancellations and delays, making it the perfect time to grab your passport and hop on the next plane – YOLO!  If there is one thing two years in lockdown has taught us, it is the importance of physical and mental health. With this new-found respect and appreciation for our well-being, we’ve shifted our priorities at home, at work and in the way we travel. Travel destinations that are rich in culture or nature and travel options with a lower carbon footprint, such as outdoor escapes or wellness retreats in remote locations is a major trend that’s here to stay.  Along with being more mindful about your next holiday, travellers in 2023 are also on the lookout for something different. Going off the grid, stepping out of your comfort zone by opting for the lesser-known places, going on a niche volunteer holiday and trying to immerse yourself in a new culture or a different language are all ways to make your holiday a true experience.
