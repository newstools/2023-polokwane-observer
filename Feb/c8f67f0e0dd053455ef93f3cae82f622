POLOKWANE – Noorderland High School’s Koketso Segwata Mogale is compassionate and helps those in need. The 18-year-old Gr 11 learner explained that his need to help those less fortunate than himself started in primary school after he noticed the plight of others. “Some learners at my primary and nearest school were going to school without proper school uniform and that touched me. I told myself that I will change that one day,” he explained. Koketso founded the Segwata Foundation and was able to donate to uniform to two schools in Ga Dikgale in January. “I believe that every child deserves the dignity to look decent like every other child. They don’t deserve to be bullied simply because they don’t have school uniform, I wanted them to blend in and learn without hinderance. Children that come from disadvantaged backgrounds did not choose to be born poor, so they are the ones that inspired me to lend a helping hand,” he said. He recently fed homeless people on the streets of Polokwane and explained that he gets satisfaction from being able to share the little that he has with others. Koketso says that he receives donations at times but that he also funds some of the initiatives out of his own pocket He is currently running a toiletry drive and he is urging people to donate sanitary towels which will be distributed to under privileged communities at the end of February. Donors can reach him via WhatsApp on 082 616 9351 or call 079 555 8881.
